/*!
 * \brief Base for directing lib{xml2,xslt} log into standard libqb backend
 *
 * This macro implements the core of what can be needed for directing
 * libxml2 or libxslt error messaging into standard, preconfigured
 * libqb-backed log stream.
 *
 * It's a bit unfortunate that libxml2 (and more sparsely, also libxslt)
 * emits a single message by chunks (location is emitted separatedly from
 * the message itself), so we have to take the effort to combine these
 * chunks back to single message.  Whether to do this or not is driven
 * with \p dechunk toggle.
 *
 * The form of a macro was chosen for implicit deriving of __FILE__, etc.
 * and also because static dechunking buffer should be differentiated per
 * library (here we assume different functions referring to this macro
 * will not ever be using both at once), preferably also per-library
 * context of use to avoid clashes altogether.
 *
 * Note that we cannot use qb_logt, because callsite data have to be known
 * at the moment of compilation, which it is not always the case -- xml_log
 * (and unfortunately there's no clear explanation of the fail to compile).
 *
 * Also note that there's no explicit guard against said libraries producing
 * never-newline-terminated chunks (which would just keep consuming memory),
 * as it's quite improbable.  Termination of the program in between the
 * same-message chunks will raise a flag with valgrind and the likes, though.
 *
 * And lastly, regarding how dechunking combines with other non-message
 * parameters -- for \p priority, most important running specification
 * wins (possibly elevated to LOG_ERR in case of nonconformance with the
 * newline-termination "protocol"), \p dechunk is expected to always be
 * on once it was at the start, and the rest (\p postemit and \p prefix)
 * are picked directly from the last chunk entry finalizing the message
 * (also reasonable to always have it the same with all related entries).
 *
 * \param[in] priority Syslog priority for the message to be logged
 * \param[in] dechunk  Whether to dechunk new-line terminated message
 * \param[in] postemit Code to be executed once message is sent out
 * \param[in] prefix   How to prefix the message or NULL for raw passing
 * \param[in] fmt      Format string as with printf-like functions
 * \param[in] ap       Variable argument list to supplement \p fmt format string

 * \brief Indicators of which XML characters to escape
 *
 * XML allows the escaping of special characters by replacing them with entity
 * references (for example, <tt>"&quot;"</tt>) or character references (for
 * example, <tt>"&#13;"</tt>).
 *
 * The special characters <tt>'&'</tt> (except as the beginning of an entity
 * reference) and <tt>'<'</tt> are not allowed in their literal forms in XML
 * character data. Character data is non-markup text (for example, the content
 * of a text node). <tt>'>'</tt> is allowed under most circumstances; we escape
 * it for safety and symmetry.
 *
 * For more details, see the "Character Data and Markup" section of the XML
 * spec, currently section 2.4:
 * https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#dt-markup
 *
 * Attribute values are handled specially.
 * * If an attribute value is delimited by single quotes, then single quotes
 *   must be escaped within the value.
 * * Similarly, if an attribute value is delimited by double quotes, then double
 *   quotes must be escaped within the value.
 * * A conformant XML processor replaces a literal whitespace character (tab,
 *   newline, carriage return, space) in an attribute value with a space
 *   (\c '#x20') character. However, a reference to a whitespace character (for
 *   example, \c "&#x0A;" for \c '\n') does not get replaced.
 *   * For more details, see the "Attribute-Value Normalization" section of the
 *     XML spec, currently section 3.3.3. Note that the default attribute type
 *     is CDATA; we don't deal with NMTOKENS, etc.:
 *     https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#AVNormalize
 *
 * Pacemaker always delimits attribute values with double quotes, so there's no
 * need to escape single quotes.
 *
 * Newlines and tabs should be escaped in attribute values when XML is
 * serialized to text, so that future parsing preserves them rather than
 * normalizing them to spaces.
 *
 * We always escape carriage returns, so that they're not converted to spaces
 * during attribute-value normalization and because displaying them as literals
 * is messy.
