# DefaultDependencies takes care of sysinit.target,
# basic.target, and shutdown.target

# We need networking to bind to a network address. It is recommended not to
# use Wants or Requires with network.target, and not to use
# network-online.target for server daemons.
After=network.target

# Time syncs can make the clock jump backward, which messes with logging
# and failure timestamps, so wait until it's done.
After=time-sync.target

# Managing systemd resources requires DBus.
After=dbus.service
Wants=dbus.service

# Some OCF resources may have dependencies that aren't managed by the cluster;
# these must be started before Pacemaker and stopped after it. The
# resource-agents package provides this target, which lets system adminstrators
# add drop-ins for those dependencies.

# Systemd v227 and above can limit the number of processes spawned by a
# service. That is a bad idea for an HA cluster resource manager, so disable it
# by default. The administrator can create a local override if they really want
# a limit. If your systemd version does not support TasksMax, and you want to
# get rid of the resulting log warnings, comment out this option.
TasksMax=infinity

# If pacemakerd doesn't stop, it's probably waiting on a cluster
# resource.  Sending -KILL will just get the node fenced
SendSIGKILL=no

# Systemd's default of respawning a failed service after 100ms is too aggressive
RestartSec=1s

# If we ever hit the StartLimitInterval/StartLimitBurst limit, and the
# admin wants to stop the cluster while pacemakerd is not running, it
# might be a good idea to enable the ExecStopPost directive below.
#
# However, the node will likely end up being fenced as a result, so it's
# not enabled by default.
#
# ExecStopPost=/usr/bin/killall -TERM pacemaker-attrd pacemaker-based \
#              pacemaker-controld pacemaker-execd pacemaker-fenced \
#              pacemaker-schedulerd

# If you want Corosync to stop whenever Pacemaker is stopped,
# uncomment the next line too:
#
# ExecStopPost=/bin/sh -c 'pidof pacemaker-controld || killall -TERM corosync'

# Pacemaker will restart along with Corosync if Corosync is stopped while
# Pacemaker is running.
# In this case, if you want to be fenced always (if you do not want to restart)
# uncomment ExecStopPost below.
# 
# ExecStopPost=/bin/sh -c 'pidof corosync || \
#              /usr/bin/systemctl --no-block stop pacemaker'

# When the service functions properly, it will wait to exit until all resources
# have been stopped on the local node, and potentially across all nodes that
# are shutting down.  The default of 30min should cover most typical cluster
# configurations, but it may need an increase to adapt to local conditions
# (e.g. a large, clustered database could conceivably take longer to stop).
TimeoutStopSec=30min
TimeoutStartSec=60s

# Restart options include: no, on-success, on-failure, on-abort or always
Restart=on-failure

# crm_perror() writes directly to stderr, so ignore it here
# to avoid double-logging with the wrong format
StandardError=null
