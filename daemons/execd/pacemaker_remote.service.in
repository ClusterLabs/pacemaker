# Systemd v227 and above can limit the number of processes spawned by a
# service. That is a bad idea for an HA cluster resource manager, so disable it
# by default. The administrator can create a local override if they really want
# a limit. If your systemd version does not support TasksMax, and you want to
# get rid of the resulting log warnings, comment out this option.
TasksMax=infinity

# Pacemaker Remote can exit only after all managed services have shut down;
# an HA database could conceivably take even longer than this 
TimeoutStopSec=30min
TimeoutStartSec=30s

# Restart options include: no, on-success, on-failure, on-abort or always
Restart=on-failure

# crm_perror() writes directly to stderr, so ignore it here
# to avoid double-logging with the wrong format
