Transition Summary:
  * Fence (reboot) hadev3 'peer is no longer part of the cluster'
  * Move       DcIPaddr              ( hadev2 -> hadev1 )
  * Move       rsc_hadev2            ( hadev2 -> hadev1 )
  * Stop       child_DoFencing:2     (           hadev1 )  due to node availability
  * Stop       child_DoFencing:0     (           hadev2 )  due to node availability
