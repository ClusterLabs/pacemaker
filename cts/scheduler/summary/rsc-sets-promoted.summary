Current cluster status:
  * Node List:
    * Node node1: standby (with active resources)
    * Online: [ node2 ]

Transition Summary:
  * Stop       rsc:0   (               Promoted node1 )  due to node availability
  * Promote    rsc:1   ( Unpromoted -> Promoted node2 )
  * Move       rsc1    (               node1 -> node2 )
  * Move       rsc2    (               node1 -> node2 )
  * Move       rsc3    (               node1 -> node2 )
