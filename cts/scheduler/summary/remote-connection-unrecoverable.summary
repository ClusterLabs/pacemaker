Current cluster status:
  * Node List:
    * Node node1: UNCLEAN (offline)
    * Online: [ node2 ]
    * RemoteOnline: [ remote1 ]

  * Full List of Resources:
    * remote1	(ocf:pacemaker:remote):	 Started node1 (UNCLEAN)
    * killer	(stonith:fence_xvm):	 Started node2
    * rsc1	(ocf:pacemaker:Dummy):	 Started remote1
    * Clone Set: rsc2-master [rsc2] (promotable):
      * rsc2	(ocf:pacemaker:Stateful):	 Promoted node1 (UNCLEAN)
      * Promoted: [ node2 ]
      * Stopped: [ remote1 ]

Transition Summary:
  * Fence (reboot) remote1 'resources are active but connection is unrecoverable'
  * Fence (reboot) node1 'peer is no longer part of the cluster'
  * Stop       remote1     (            node1 )  due to node availability
  * Restart    killer      (            node2 )  due to resource definition change
  * Move       rsc1        ( remote1 -> node2 )
  * Stop       rsc2:0      (   Promoted node1 )  due to node availability
