If this is set to 0 (the default), the cluster will never assume watchdog-based self-fencing. If this is set to a negative value, the cluster will use twice the local value of the `SBD_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT` environment variable if that is positive, or otherwise treat this as 0. WARNING: When used, this timeout must be larger than `SBD_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT` on all nodes that use watchdog-based SBD, and Pacemaker will refuse to start on any of those nodes where this is not true for the local value or SBD is not active. When this is set to a negative value, `SBD_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT` must be set to the same value on all nodes that use SBD, otherwise data corruption or loss could occur.

        When true, resources active on a node when it is cleanly shut down are kept "locked" to that node (not allowed to run elsewhere) until they start again on that node after it rejoins (or for at most shutdown-lock-limit, if set). Stonith resources and Pacemaker Remote connections are never locked. Clone and bundle instances and the promoted role of promotable clones are currently never locked, though support could be added in a future release.

A promoted resource instance takes the base priority + 1 on calculation if the base priority is not 0. Any static/random delays that are introduced by `pcmk_delay_base/max` configured for the corresponding fencing resources will be added to this delay. This delay should be significantly greater than, safely twice, the maximum `pcmk_delay_base/max`. By default, priority fencing delay is disabled.
