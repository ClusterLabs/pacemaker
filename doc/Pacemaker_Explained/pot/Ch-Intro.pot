msgid "Pacemaker is a cluster resource manager. It achieves maximum availability for your cluster services (aka. resources) by detecting and recovering from node and resource-level failures by making use of the messaging and membership capabilities provided by your preferred cluster infrastructure (either <ulink url=\"http://www.corosync.org/\">Corosync</ulink> or <ulink url=\"http://XXXX/TODO\">Heartbeat</ulink>)."

This may include moving resources, stopping nodes and even forcing nodes offline with remote power switches."

Technically it would be possible for them to support Heartbeat as well, however there seems little interest in this. </para> </footnote>. Due to recent standardization within the cluster filesystem community, they make use of a common distributed lock manager which makes use of Corosync for its messaging capabilities and Pacemaker for its membership (which nodes are up/down) and fencing services."

STONITH is an acronym for Shoot-The-Other-Node-In-The-Head and is usually implemented with a remote power switch. In Pacemaker, STONITH devices are modeled as resources (and configured in the CIB) to enable them to be easily monitored for failure, however STONITHd takes care of understanding the STONITH topology such that its clients simply request a node be fenced and it does the rest."
