msgid "Multi-site clusters can be considered as “overlay” clusters where each cluster site corresponds to a cluster node in a traditional cluster. The overlay cluster can be managed by a CTR in order to guarantee that any cluster resource will be active on no more than one cluster site. This is achieved by using <emphasis>tickets</emphasis> that are treated as failover domain between cluster sites, in case a site should be down."

msgid "Tickets are, essentially, cluster-wide attributes. A ticket grants the right to run certain resources on a specific cluster site. Resources can be bound to a certain ticket by <literal>rsc_ticket</literal> constraints. Only if the ticket is available at a site can the respective resources be started there. Vice versa, if the ticket is revoked, the resources depending on that ticket must be stopped."

#. Tag: para

msgid "The ticket thus is similar to a <emphasis>site quorum</emphasis>, i.e. the permission to manage/own resources associated with that site. (One can also think of the current <literal>have-quorum</literal> flag as a special, cluster-wide ticket that is granted in case of node majority.)"
