== Defining a Cluster Node ==

Each node in the cluster will have an entry in the nodes section
containing its UUID, uname, and type.

.Example Heartbeat cluster node entry
======
[source,XML]
<node id="1186dc9a-324d-425a-966e-d757e693dc86" uname="pcmk-1" type="normal"/>
======

.Example Corosync cluster node entry
======
[source,XML]
<node id="101" uname="pcmk-1" type="normal"/>
======

In normal circumstances, the admin should let the cluster populate
this information automatically from the communications and membership
data.  However for Heartbeat, one can use the `crm_uuid` tool
to read an existing UUID or define a value before the cluster starts.

[[s-node-name]]
== Where Pacemaker Gets the Node Name ==

Traditionally, Pacemaker required nodes to be referred to by the value
returned by `uname -n`.  This can be problematic for services that
require the `uname -n` to be a specific value (e.g. for a licence
file).

This requirement has been relaxed for clusters using Corosync 2.0 or later.
The name Pacemaker uses is:

. The value stored in +corosync.conf+ under *ring0_addr* in the *nodelist*, if it does not contain an IP address; otherwise
. The value stored in +corosync.conf+ under *name* in the *nodelist*; otherwise
. The value of `uname -n`

Pacemaker provides the `crm_node -n` command which displays the name
used by a running cluster.

If a Corosync *nodelist* is used, `crm_node --name-for-id` pass:[<replaceable>number</replaceable>] is also
available to display the name used by the node with the corosync
*nodeid* of pass:[<replaceable>number</replaceable>], for example: `crm_node --name-for-id 2`.

[[s-node-attributes]]
== Describing a Cluster Node ==

indexterm:[Node,attribute]
Beyond the basic definition of a node the administrator can also
describe the node's attributes, such as how much RAM, disk, what OS or
kernel version it has, perhaps even its physical location.  This
information can then be used by the cluster when deciding where to
place resources.  For more information on the use of node attributes,
see <<ch-rules>>.

Node attributes can be specified ahead of time or populated later,
when the cluster is running, using `crm_attribute`.

Below is what the node's definition would look like if the admin ran the command:
      
.Result of using crm_attribute to specify which kernel pcmk-1 is running
======
-------
# crm_attribute --type nodes --node pcmk-1 --name kernel --update $(uname -r)
-------
[source,XML]
-------
<node uname="pcmk-1" type="normal" id="101">
   <instance_attributes id="nodes-101">
     <nvpair id="nodes-101-kernel" name="kernel" value="3.10.0-123.13.2.el7.x86_64"/>
   </instance_attributes>
</node>
-------
======
Rather than having to read the XML, a simpler way to determine the current
value of an attribute is to use `crm_attribute` again:

----
# crm_attribute --type nodes --node pcmk-1 --name kernel --query
scope=nodes  name=kernel value=3.10.0-123.13.2.el7.x86_64
----

By specifying `--type nodes` the admin tells the cluster that this
attribute is persistent.  There are also transient attributes which
are kept in the status section which are "forgotten" whenever the node
rejoins the cluster.  The cluster uses this area to store a record of
how many times a resource has failed on that node, but administrators
can also read and write to this section by specifying `--type status`.

== Corosync ==

=== Adding a New Corosync Node ===

indexterm:[Corosync,Add Cluster Node]
indexterm:[Add Cluster Node,Corosync]

Adding a new node is as simple as installing Corosync and Pacemaker,
and copying '/etc/corosync/corosync.conf' and '/etc/corosync/authkey' (if
it exists) from an existing node.  You may need to modify the
+mcastaddr+ option to match the new node's IP address.

If a log message containing "Invalid digest" appears from Corosync,
the keys are not consistent between the machines.

=== Removing a Corosync Node ===

indexterm:[Corosync,Remove Cluster Node]
indexterm:[Remove Cluster Node,Corosync]

Because the messaging and membership layers are the authoritative
source for cluster nodes, deleting them from the CIB is not a reliable
solution.  First one must arrange for corosync to forget about the
node (_pcmk-1_ in the example below).

On the host to be removed:

. Stop the cluster: `/etc/init.d/corosync stop`

Next, from one of the remaining active cluster nodes:

. Tell Pacemaker to forget about the removed host:
+
----
# crm_node -R pcmk-1
----
+
This includes deleting the node from the CIB

[NOTE]
======
This procedure only works for pacemaker 1.1.8 and later.

=== Replacing a Corosync Node ===

indexterm:[Corosync,Replace Cluster Node]
indexterm:[Replace Cluster Node,Corosync]

The five-step guide to replacing an existing cluster node:

. Make sure the old node is completely stopped
. Give the new machine the same hostname and IP address as the old one
. Install the cluster software :-)
. Copy '/etc/corosync/corosync.conf' and '/etc/corosync/authkey' (if it exists) to the new node
. Start the new cluster node

If a log message containing "Invalid digest" appears from Corosync,
the keys are not consistent between the machines.

== Heartbeat ==

=== Adding a New Heartbeat Node ===

indexterm:[Heartbeat,Add Cluster Node]
indexterm:[Add Cluster Node,Heartbeat]

Provided you specified +autojoin any+ in 'ha.cf', adding a new node is
as simple as installing heartbeat and copying 'ha.cf' and 'authkeys'
from an existing node.

If you don't want to use +autojoin+, then after setting up 'ha.cf' and
'authkeys', you must use `hb_addnode` before starting the new node.

=== Removing a Heartbeat Node ===

indexterm:[Heartbeat,Remove Cluster Node]
indexterm:[Remove Cluster Node,Heartbeat]

Because the messaging and membership layers are the authoritative
source for cluster nodes, deleting them from the CIB is not a reliable
solution.

First one must arrange for Heartbeat to forget about the node (pcmk-1
in the example below).

On the host to be removed:

. Stop the cluster: `/etc/init.d/corosync stop`

Next, from one of the remaining active cluster nodes:

. Tell Heartbeat the node should be removed

----
# hb_delnode pcmk-1
----

. Tell Pacemaker to forget about the removed host:

----
# crm_node -R pcmk-1
----

[NOTE]
======
This proceedure only works for versions after 1.1.8
======

=== Replacing a Heartbeat Node ===

indexterm:[Heartbeat,Replace Cluster Node]
indexterm:[Replace Cluster Node,Heartbeat]
The seven-step guide to replacing an existing cluster node:

. Make sure the old node is completely stopped
. Give the new machine the same hostname as the old one
. Go to an active cluster node and look up the UUID for the old node in '/var/lib/heartbeat/hostcache'
. Install the cluster software
. Copy 'ha.cf' and 'authkeys' to the new node
. On the new node, populate it's UUID using `crm_uuid -w` and the UUID from step 2
. Start the new cluster node
