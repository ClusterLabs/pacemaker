=== Choosing a Cluster Stack ===
indexterm:[Cluster Stack,choosing one]

Ultimately the choice of cluster stack is a personal decision that
must be made in the context of you or your company's needs and
strategic direction. Pacemaker currently functions equally well with
both stacks.

Here are some factors that may influence the decision:

* SUSE/Novell, Red Hat and Oracle are all putting their collective
  weight behind the Corosync cluster stack.
  indexterm:[Cluster Stack,Corosync]
  indexterm:[Corosync]
* Using Corosync gives your applications access to the following
  additional cluster services
** distributed locking service
** extended virtual synchronization service
** cluster closed process group service
* It is likely that Pacemaker, at some point in the future, will make
  use of some of these additional services not provided by Heartbeat

=== Enabling Pacemaker ===

==== For Corosync ====

The Corosync configuration is normally located in
'/etc/corosync/corosync.conf' and an example for a machine with an
address of +1.2.3.4+ in a cluster communicating on port 1234 (without
peer authentication and message encryption) is shown below.

.An example Corosync configuration file
[source,XML]
-------
  totem {
      version: 2
      secauth: off
      threads: 0
      interface {
          ringnumber: 0
          bindnetaddr: 1.2.3.4
          mcastaddr: 239.255.1.1
          mcastport: 1234
      }
  }
  logging {
      fileline: off
      to_syslog: yes
      syslog_facility: daemon
  }
  amf {
      mode: disabled
  }
        
-------

The logging should be mostly obvious and the amf section refers to the
Availability Management Framework and is not covered in this document.

The interesting part of the configuration is the totem section. This
is where we define how the node can communicate with the rest of the
cluster and what protocol version and options (including encryption
footnote:[
Please consult the Corosync website (http://www.corosync.org/) and documentation for details on enabling encryption and peer authentication for the cluster.
]
) it should use. Beginners are encouraged to use the values shown and
modify the interface section based on their network.

It is also possible to configure Corosync for an IPv6 based
environment. Simply configure +bindnetaddr+ and +mcastaddr+ with their
IPv6 equivalents, eg.

.Example options for an IPv6 environment
[source,Bash]
-------
  bindnetaddr: fec0::1:a800:4ff:fe00:20
  mcastaddr: ff05::1
-------

To tell Corosync to use the Pacemaker cluster manager, add the
following fragment to a functional Corosync configuration and restart
the cluster.

.Configuration fragment for enabling Pacemaker under Corosync
[source,XML]
-------
aisexec {
    user:  root
    group: root
}
service {
    name: pacemaker
    ver: 0
}
-------

The cluster needs to be run as root so that its child processes (the
+lrmd+ in particular) have sufficient privileges to perform the
actions requested of it. After all, a cluster manager that can't add
an IP address or start apache is of little use.

The second directive is the one that actually instructs the cluster to
run Pacemaker.

==== For Heartbeat ====

Add the following to a functional _ha.cf_ configuration file and restart Heartbeat:
