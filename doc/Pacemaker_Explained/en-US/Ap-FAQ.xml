            <para>Why is the Project Called <indexterm significance="preferred"><primary>Pacemaker</primary><secondary>naming</secondary></indexterm>Pacemaker?</para>
          </question>

              The Pacemaker name came from Kham<footnote><para><ulink url="http://khamsouk.souvanlasy.com/"/></para></footnote>, a good friend of mine, and was originally used by a Java GUI that I was prototyping in early 2007.

            <para>
              The idea stems from the analogy between the role of this software and that of the little device that keeps the human heart pumping.
              Pacemaker monitors the cluster and intervenes when necessary to ensure the smooth operation of the services it provides.
