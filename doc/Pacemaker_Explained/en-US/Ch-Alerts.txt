'Alerts' may be configured to take some external action when a cluster event
occurs (node failure, resource starting or stopping, etc.).


== Alert Agents ==

As with resource agents, the cluster calls an external program (an
'alert agent') to handle alerts. The cluster passes information about the event
to the agent via environment variables. Agents can do anything
desired with this information (send an e-mail, log to a file,
update a monitoring system, etc.).


.Simple alert configuration
=====
[source,XML]
-----
<configuration>
    <alerts>
        <alert id="my-alert" path="/path/to/my-script.sh" />
    </alerts>
</configuration>
-----
=====

In the example above, the cluster will call +my-script.sh+ for each event.

Multiple alert agents may be configured; the cluster will call all of them for
each event.


== Alert Recipients ==

Each alert may be configured with one or more recipients.
The cluster will call the agent separately for each recipient.

.Alert configuration with recipient
=====
[source,XML]
-----
<configuration>
    <alerts>
        <alert id="my-alert" path="/path/to/my-script.sh">
            <recipient id="my-alert-recipient" value="some-address"/>
        </alert>
    </alerts>
</configuration>
-----
=====

In the above example, the cluster will call +my-script.sh+ for each event,
passing the recipient +some-address+ as an environment variable.

The recipient may be anything the alert agent can recognize --
an IP address, an e-mail address, a file name, whatever the particular
agent supports.


== Alert Meta-Attributes ==

As with resource agents, meta-attributes can be configured for alert agents
to affect how Pacemaker calls them.

.Meta-Attributes of an Alert

[width="95%",cols="m,1,2<a",options="header",align="center"]
|=========================================================

|Meta-Attribute
|Default
|Description

|timestamp-format
|%H:%M:%S.%06N
|Format the cluster will use when sending the event's timestamp to the agent.
 This is a string as used with the `date(1)` command.
 indexterm:[Alert,Option,timestamp-format]
 
|timeout
|30s
|If the alert agent does not complete within this amount of time, it will be
 terminated.
 indexterm:[Alert,Option,timeout]

|=========================================================

Meta-attributes can be configured per alert agent and/or per recipient.

.Alert configuration with meta-attributes
=====
[source,XML]
-----
<configuration>
    <alerts>
        <alert id="my-alert" path="/path/to/my-script.sh">
            <meta_attributes id="my-alert-attributes">
		<nvpair id="my-alert-attributes-timeout" name="timeout"
                    value="15s"/>
            </meta_attributes>
            <recipient id="my-alert-recipient1" value="someuser@example.com">
                <meta_attributes id="my-alert-recipient1-attributes">
                    <nvpair id="my-alert-recipient1-timestamp-format"
                        name="timestamp-format" value="%D %H:%M"/>
                </meta_attributes>
            </recipient>
            <recipient id="my-alert-recipient2" value="otheruser@example.com">
                <meta_attributes id="my-alert-recipient2-attributes">
                    <nvpair id="my-alert-recipient2-timestamp-format"
                        name="timestamp-format" value="%c"/>
                </meta_attributes>
            </recipient>
        </alert>
    </alerts>
</configuration>
-----
=====

In the above example, the +my-script.sh+ will get called twice for each event,
with each call using a 15-second timeout. One call will be passed the recipient
+someuser@example.com+ and a timestamp in the format +%D %H:%M+, while the
other call will be passed the recipient +otheruser@example.com+ and a timestamp
in the format +%c+.


== Alert Instance Attributes ==

As with resource agents, agent-specific configuration values may be configured
as instance attributes. These will be passed to the agent as additional
environment variables. The number, names and allowed values of these
instance attributes are completely up to the particular agent.

<configuration>
    <alerts>
        <alert id="my-alert" path="/path/to/my-script.sh">
            <meta_attributes id="my-alert-attributes">
                <nvpair id="my-alert-attributes-timeout" name="timeout"
                    value="15s"/>
            </meta_attributes>
            <instance_attributes id="my-alert-options">
                <nvpair id="my-alert-options-debug" name="debug" value="false"/>
            </instance_attributes>
            <recipient id="my-alert-recipient1" value="someuser@example.com"/>
        </alert>
    </alerts>
</configuration>
-----
=====


== Using the Sample Alert Agents ==

Several sample alert agents are provided in the
https://github.com/ClusterLabs/pacemaker/tree/master/extra/alerts[+extra/alerts+]
directory of the pacemaker source tree. If you installed Pacemaker via a
package, these might be available somewhere on your system, such as
+/usr/share/pacemaker+.

While these sample scripts may be used directly as alert agents,
they are provided mainly as templates to be edited to suit your purposes.
See their source code for the full set of instance attributes they support.

== Writing an Alert Agent ==


.Environment variables passed to alert agents

[width="95%",cols="m,2<a",options="header",align="center"]
|=========================================================

|Environment Variable
|Description

|CRM_alert_kind
|The type of alert (+node+, +fencing+, or +resource+)
 indexterm:[Environment Variable,CRM_alert_,kind]

|CRM_alert_version
|The version of Pacemaker sending the alert
 indexterm:[Environment Variable,CRM_alert_,version]

|CRM_alert_recipient
|The configured recipient
 indexterm:[Environment Variable,CRM_alert_,recipient]

|CRM_alert_node_sequence
|A sequence number increased whenever an alert is being issued on the
 local node, which can be used to reference the order in which alerts have been
 issued by Pacemaker. An alert for an event that happened later in time
 reliably has a higher sequence number than alerts for earlier events.
 Be aware that this number has no cluster-wide meaning.
 indexterm:[Environment Variable,CRM_alert_node_,sequence]

|CRM_alert_timestamp
|A timestamp created prior to executing the agent, in the format
 specified by the +timestamp-format+ meta-attribute. This allows the agent
 to have a reliable, high-precision time of when the event occurred,
 regardless of when the agent itself was invoked (which could potentially
 be delayed due to system load, etc.).
 indexterm:[Environment Variable,CRM_alert_,timestamp]

|CRM_alert_node
|Name of affected node
 indexterm:[Environment Variable,CRM_alert_,node]

|CRM_alert_desc
|Detail about event. For +node+ alerts, this is the node's current state
 (+member+ or +lost+). For +fencing+ alerts, this is a summary of the
 requested fencing operation, including origin, target, and fencing operation
 error code, if any. For +resource+ alerts, this is a readable string
 equivalent of +CRM_alert_status+.
 indexterm:[Environment Variable,CRM_alert_,desc]

|CRM_alert_nodeid
|ID of node whose status changed (provided with +node+ alerts only)
 indexterm:[Environment Variable,CRM_alert_,nodeid]

|CRM_alert_task
|The requested fencing or resource operation
 (provided with +fencing+ and +resource+ alerts only)
 indexterm:[Environment Variable,CRM_alert_,task]

|CRM_alert_rc
|The numerical return code of the fencing or resource operation
 (provided with +fencing+ and +resource+ alerts only)
 indexterm:[Environment Variable,CRM_alert_,rc]

|CRM_alert_rsc
|The name of the affected resource (+resource+ alerts only)
 indexterm:[Environment Variable,CRM_alert_,rsc]

|CRM_alert_interval
|The interval of the resource operation (+resource+ alerts only)
 indexterm:[Environment Variable,CRM_alert_,interval]

|CRM_alert_target_rc
|The expected numerical return code of the operation (+resource+ alerts only)
 indexterm:[Environment Variable,CRM_alert_,target_rc]

|CRM_alert_status
|A numerical code used by Pacemaker to represent the operation result
 (+resource+ alerts only)
 indexterm:[Environment Variable,CRM_alert_,status]

|=========================================================

Special concerns when writing alert agents:

* Alert agents will be called once per recipient. If an agent is not
  able to run concurrently, it should be configured with only a single
  recipient. The agent is free, however, to interpret the recipient
  as a list.

* Alert agents are run as the +hacluster+ user, which has a minimal set
  of permissions. If an agent requires additional privileges, it is
  recommended to configure +sudo+ to allow the agent to run the necessary
  commands as another user with the appropriate privileges.

[NOTE]
=====
The alerts interface is designed to be backward compatible with the external
scripts interface used by the +ocf:pacemaker:ClusterMon+ resource, which is
now deprecated. To preserve this compatibility, the environment variables
passed to alert agents are available prepended with +CRM_notify_+
as well as +CRM_alert_+. One break in compatibility is that ClusterMon ran
external scripts as the +root+ user, while alert agents are run as the
+hacluster+ user.
