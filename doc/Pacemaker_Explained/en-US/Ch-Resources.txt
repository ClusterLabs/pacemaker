== What is a Cluster Resource? ==

indexterm:[Resource]

A resource is a service made highly available by a cluster.
The simplest type of resource, a 'primitive' resource, is described
in this chapter. More complex forms, such as groups and clones,
are described in later chapters.

Every primitive resource has a 'resource agent'. A resource agent is an
external program that abstracts the service it provides and present a
consistent view to the cluster.

This allows the cluster to be agnostic about the resources it manages.
The cluster doesn't need to understand how the resource works because
it relies on the resource agent to do the right thing when given a
`start`, `stop` or `monitor` command. For this reason, it is crucial that
resource agents are well-tested.

Typically, resource agents come in the form of shell scripts. However,
they can be written using any technology (such as C, Python or Perl)
that the author is comfortable with.

[[s-resource-supported]]
== Resource Classes ==

indexterm:[Resource,class]

Pacemaker supports several classes of agents:

* OCF
* LSB
* Upstart
* Systemd
* Service
* Fencing
* Nagios Plugins

=== Open Cluster Framework ===

indexterm:[Resource,OCF]
indexterm:[OCF,Resources]
indexterm:[Open Cluster Framework,Resources]

The OCF standard
footnote:[See
http://www.opencf.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/specs/ra/resource-agent-api.txt?rev=HEAD
 -- at least as it relates to resource agents.  The Pacemaker implementation has
been somewhat extended from the OCF specs, but none of those changes are
incompatible with the original OCF specification.]
is basically an extension of the Linux Standard Base conventions for
init scripts to:

* support parameters,
* make them self-describing, and
* make them extensible

OCF specs have strict definitions of the exit codes that actions must return.
footnote:[
The resource-agents source code includes the `ocf-tester` script, which
can be useful in this regard.
]

The cluster follows these specifications exactly, and giving the wrong
exit code will cause the cluster to behave in ways you will likely
find puzzling and annoying.  In particular, the cluster needs to
distinguish a completely stopped resource from one which is in some
erroneous and indeterminate state.

Parameters are passed to the resource agent as environment variables, with the
special prefix +OCF_RESKEY_+.  So, a parameter which the user thinks
of as +ip+ will be passed to the resource agent as +OCF_RESKEY_ip+.  The
number and purpose of the parameters is left to the resource agent; however,
the resource agent should use the `meta-data` command to advertise any that it
supports.

The OCF class is the most preferred as it is an industry standard,
highly flexible (allowing parameters to be passed to agents in a
non-positional manner) and self-describing.

For more information, see the
http://www.linux-ha.org/wiki/OCF_Resource_Agents[reference] and
<<ap-ocf>>.

=== Linux Standard Base ===
indexterm:[Resource,LSB]
indexterm:[LSB,Resources]
indexterm:[Linux Standard Base,Resources]

LSB resource agents are those found in +/etc/init.d+.

Generally, they are provided by the OS distribution and, in order to be used
with the cluster, they must conform to the LSB Spec.
footnote:[
See
http://refspecs.linux-foundation.org/LSB_3.0.0/LSB-Core-generic/LSB-Core-generic/iniscrptact.html
for the LSB Spec as it relates to init scripts.
]

[WARNING]
====
Many distributions claim LSB compliance but ship with broken init
scripts.  For details on how to check whether your init script is
LSB-compatible, see <<ap-lsb>>. Common problematic violations of
the LSB standard include:

* Not implementing the status operation at all
* Not observing the correct exit status codes for `start/stop/status` actions
* Starting a started resource returns an error
* Stopping a stopped resource returns an error
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Remember to make sure the computer is _not_ configured to start any
services at boot time -- that should be controlled by the cluster.
====

=== Systemd ===
indexterm:[Resource,Systemd]
indexterm:[Systemd,Resources]

Some newer distributions have replaced the old
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Init#SysV-style["SysV"] style of
initialization daemons and scripts with an alternative called
http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd[Systemd].

Pacemaker is able to manage these services _if they are present_.

Instead of init scripts, systemd has 'unit files'.  Generally, the
services (unit files) are provided by the OS distribution, but there
are online guides for converting from init scripts.
footnote:[For example,
http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/systemd-for-admins-3.html]

[IMPORTANT]
====
Remember to make sure the computer is _not_ configured to start any
services at boot time -- that should be controlled by the cluster.

=== Upstart ===
indexterm:[Resource,Upstart]
indexterm:[Upstart,Resources]

Some newer distributions have replaced the old
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Init#SysV-style["SysV"] style of
initialization daemons (and scripts) with an alternative called
http://upstart.ubuntu.com/[Upstart].

Pacemaker is able to manage these services _if they are present_.

Instead of init scripts, upstart has 'jobs'.  Generally, the
services (jobs) are provided by the OS distribution.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Remember to make sure the computer is _not_ configured to start any
services at boot time -- that should be controlled by the cluster.
====

=== System Services ===
indexterm:[Resource,System Services]
indexterm:[System Service,Resources]

Since there are various types of system services (+systemd+,
+upstart+, and +lsb+), Pacemaker supports a special +service+ alias which
intelligently figures out which one applies to a given cluster node.

This is particularly useful when the cluster contains a mix of
+systemd+, +upstart+, and +lsb+.

In order, Pacemaker will try to find the named service as:

. an LSB init script
. a Systemd unit file
. an Upstart job

=== STONITH ===
indexterm:[Resource,STONITH]
indexterm:[STONITH,Resources]

The STONITH class is used exclusively for fencing-related resources.  This is
discussed later in <<ch-stonith>>.

=== Nagios Plugins ===
indexterm:[Resource,Nagios Plugins]
indexterm:[Nagios Plugins,Resources]

Nagios Plugins
footnote:[The project has two independent forks, hosted at
https://www.nagios-plugins.org/ and https://www.monitoring-plugins.org/. Output
from both projects' plugins is similar, so plugins from either project can be
used with pacemaker.]
allow us to monitor services on remote hosts.

Pacemaker is able to do remote monitoring with the plugins _if they are
present_.

A common use case is to configure them as resources belonging to a resource
container (usually a virtual machine), and the container will be restarted
if any of them has failed. Another use is to configure them as ordinary
resources to be used for monitoring hosts or services via the network.

The supported parameters are same as the long options of the plugin.

[[primitive-resource]]
== Resource Properties ==

These values tell the cluster which resource agent to use for the resource,
where to find that resource agent and what standards it conforms to.

Resources have two types of options: 'meta-attributes' and 'instance attributes'.
Meta-attributes apply to any type of resource, while instance attributes
are specific to each resource agent.

=== Resource Meta-Attributes ===

Meta-attributes are used by the cluster to decide how a resource should
behave and can be easily set using the `--meta` option of the
`crm_resource` command.

[NOTE]
====
Support for remote nodes was added in pacemaker 1.1.10. If you are using an
earlier version, options related to remote nodes will not be available.
====

As an example of setting resource options, if you performed the following
commands on an LSB Email resource:

-------
# crm_resource --meta --resource Email --set-parameter priority --parameter-value 100
# crm_resource -m -r Email -p multiple-active -v block
-------

the resulting resource definition might be:

.An LSB resource with cluster options
=====
[source,XML]
-------
<primitive id="Email" class="lsb" type="exim">
  <meta_attributes id="Email-meta_attributes">
    <nvpair id="Email-meta_attributes-priority" name="priority" value="100"/>
    <nvpair id="Email-meta_attributes-multiple-active" name="multiple-active" value="block"/>
  </meta_attributes>
</primitive>
-------
=====

[[s-resource-defaults]]
=== Setting Global Defaults for Resource Meta-Attributes ===

To set a default value for a resource option, add it to the
+rsc_defaults+ section with `crm_attribute`. For example,

----
# crm_attribute --type rsc_defaults --name is-managed --update false
----

would prevent the cluster from starting or stopping any of the
resources in the configuration (unless of course the individual
resources were specifically enabled by having their +is-managed+ set to
+true+).

=== Resource Instance Attributes ===

The resource agents of some resource classes (lsb, systemd and upstart 'not' among them)
can be given parameters which determine how they behave and which instance
of a service they control.

If your resource agent supports parameters, you can add them with the
`crm_resource` command. For example,

----
# crm_resource --resource Public-IP --set-parameter ip --parameter-value 192.0.2.2
----

would create an entry in the resource like this:

.An example OCF resource with instance attributes
=====
[source,XML]
-------
<primitive id="Public-IP" class="ocf" type="IPaddr" provider="heartbeat">
   <instance_attributes id="params-public-ip">
      <nvpair id="public-ip-addr" name="ip" value="192.0.2.2"/>
   </instance_attributes>
</primitive>
-------
=====

For an OCF resource, the result would be an environment variable
called +OCF_RESKEY_ip+ with a value of +192.0.2.2+.

The list of instance attributes supported by an OCF resource agent can be
found by calling the resource agent with the `meta-data` command.
The output contains an XML description of all the supported
attributes, their purpose and default values.

== Resource Operations ==

indexterm:[Resource,Action]

Operations are actions the cluster can perform on a resource,
such as start, stop and monitor.

As an example, by default the cluster will not ensure your resources are still
healthy.  To instruct the cluster to do this, you need to add a
+monitor+ operation to the resource's definition.

 indexterm:[Action,Property,enabled]

|=========================================================

[[s-operation-defaults]]
=== Setting Global Defaults for Operations ===

You can change the global default values for operation properties
in a given cluster. These are defined in an +op_defaults+ section 
of the CIB's +configuration+ section, and can be set with `crm_attribute`.
For example,

----
# crm_attribute --type op_defaults --name timeout --update 20s
----

would default each operation's +timeout+ to 20 seconds.  If an
operation's definition also includes a value for +timeout+, then that
value would be used for that operation instead.

=== When Resources Take a Long Time to Start/Stop ===

The cluster will always perform a number of implicit operations: +start+,
+stop+ and a non-recurring +monitor+ operation used at startup to check
whether the resource is already active.  If one of these is taking too long,
then you can create an entry for them and specify a longer timeout.

.An OCF resource with custom timeouts for its implicit actions

     <nvpair id="public-ip-addr" name="ip" value="192.0.2.2"/>
  </instance_attributes>
</primitive>
-------
=====

=== Multiple Monitor Operations ===

Provided no two operations (for a single resource) have the same name
and interval, you can have as many monitor operations as you like.  In
this way, you can do a superficial health check every minute and
progressively more intense ones at higher intervals.

To tell the resource agent what kind of check to perform, you need to
provide each monitor with a different value for a common parameter.
The OCF standard creates a special parameter called +OCF_CHECK_LEVEL+
for this purpose and dictates that it is "made available to the
resource agent without the normal +OCF_RESKEY+ prefix".

Whatever name you choose, you can specify it by adding an
+instance_attributes+ block to the +op+ tag. It is up to each
resource agent to look for the parameter and decide how to use it.

=====

=== Disabling a Monitor Operation ===

The easiest way to stop a recurring monitor is to just delete it.
However, there can be times when you only want to disable it
temporarily.  In such cases, simply add +enabled="false"+ to the
operation's definition.

----
# cibadmin --modify --xml-text '<op id="public-ip-check" enabled="false"/>'
----

----
# cibadmin --modify --xml-text '<op id="public-ip-check" enabled="true"/>'
----
