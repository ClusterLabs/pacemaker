	When creating your own agents, you are encouraged to create a new directory under <filename>/usr/lib/ocf/resource.d/</filename> so that they are not confused with (or overwritten by) the agents shipped with Heartbeat.
	So, for example, if you chose the provider name of bigCorp and wanted a new resource named bigApp, you would create a script called <filename>/usr/lib/ocf/resource.d/bigCorp/bigApp</filename> and define a resource:
