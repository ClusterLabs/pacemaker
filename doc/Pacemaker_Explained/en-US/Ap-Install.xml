      <para>Ultimately the choice of cluster stack is a personal decision that must be made in the context of you or your company's needs and strategic direction. Pacemaker currently functions equally well with both stacks.</para>
      <para>Here are some factors that may influence the decision:

        <para>The Corosync configuration is normally located in <filename>/etc/corosync/corosync.conf</filename> and an example for a machine with an address of <literal>1.2.3.4</literal> in a cluster communicating on port 1234 (without peer authentication and message encryption) is shown below.</para>

        <para>It is also possible to configure Corosync for an IPv6 based environment. Simply configure <literal>bindnetaddr</literal> and <literal>mcastaddr</literal> with their IPv6 equivalents, eg. </para>

        <para>The cluster needs to be run as root so that its child processes (the <literal>lrmd</literal> in particular) have sufficient privileges to perform the actions requested of it. After all, a cluster manager that can't add an IP address or start apache is of little use.</para>
