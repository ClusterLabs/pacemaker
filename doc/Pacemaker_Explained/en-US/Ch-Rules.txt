= Rules =

anchor:ch-rules[Rules]
Rules can be used to make your configuration more dynamic.  One common
example is to set one value for +resource-stickiness+ during working
hours, to prevent resources from being moved back to their most
preferred location, and another on weekends when no-one is around to
notice an outage.

Another use of rules might be to assign machines to different
processing groups (using a node attribute) based on time and to then
use that attribute when creating location constraints.

Each rule can contain a number of expressions, date-expressions and
even other rules.  The results of the expressions are combined based
on the rule's +boolean-op+ field to determine if the rule ultimately
evaluates to +true+ or +false+.  What happens next depends on the
context in which the rule is being used.

== Node Attribute Expressions ==

indexterm:[Node,Attribute Expressions]

Expression objects are used to control a resource based on the
attributes defined by a node or nodes.  In addition to any attributes
added by the administrator, each node has a built-in node attribute
called +#uname+ that can also be used.

== Time/Date Based Expressions ==

indexterm:[Time Based Expressions]
indexterm:[Expression,Time/Date Based]
        
As the name suggests, +date_expressions+ are used to control a
resource or cluster option based on the current date/time.  They can
contain an optional +date_spec+ and/or +duration+ object depending on
the context.
      
.Properties of a Date Expression
[width="95%",cols="1m,5<",options="header",align="center"]
|=========================================================
|Field
|Description

|start
|A date/time conforming to the ISO8601 specification.

|end
|A date/time conforming to the ISO8601 specification. Can be inferred
 by supplying a value for +start+ and a +duration+.

|operation
|Compares the current date/time with the start and/or end date,
 depending on the context. Allowed values:

* +gt+ - True if the current date/time is after +start+

* +lt+ - True if the current date/time is before +end+

* +in-range+ - True if the current date/time is after +start+ and before +end+

* +date-spec+ - performs a cron-like comparison to the current date/time

|=========================================================

[NOTE]
======
Because the comparisons (except for +date_spec+) include the time, the
+eq+, +neq+, +gte+ and +lte+ operators have not been
implemented.
======

=== Date Specifications ===
indexterm:[Date Specifications]

+date_spec+ objects are used to create cron-like expressions relating
to time.  Each field can contain a single number or a single range.
Instead of defaulting to zero, any field not supplied is ignored.

For example, +monthdays="1"+ matches the first day of every month and
+hours="09-17"+ matches the hours between 9am and 5pm (inclusive).
However, at this time one cannot specify +weekdays="1,2"+ or
+weekdays="1-2,5-6"+ since they contain multiple ranges.  Depending on
demand, this may be implemented in a future release.

indexterm:[Date Spec Properties,moon]
|Allowed values: 0-7 (0 is new, 4 is full moon). Seriously, you can
 use this. This was implemented to demonstrate the ease with which new
 comparisons could be added.

|=========================================================

=== Durations ===
indexterm:[Durations Expressions]
indexterm:[Expressions,Durations]

Durations are used to calculate a value for +end+ when one is not
supplied to in_range operations.  They contain the same fields as
+date_spec+ objects but without the limitations (ie. you can have a
duration of 19 months).  Like +date_specs+, any field not supplied is
ignored.

== Using Rules to Determine Resource Location ==
indexterm:[Rule,Determine Resource Location]
indexterm:[Resource,Location, Determine by Rules]

If the constraint's outer-most rule evaluates to +false+, the cluster
treats the constraint as if it was not there.  When the rule evaluates
to +true+, the node's preference for running the resource is updated
with the score associated with the rule.

If this sounds familiar, its because you have been using a simplified
syntax for location constraint rules already.  Consider the following
location constraint:
      
.Prevent myApacheRsc from running on c001n03
-------
<rsc_location id="dont-run-apache-on-c001n03" rsc="myApacheRsc" 
              score="-INFINITY" node="c001n03"/> 
-------

This constraint can be more verbosely written as:

.Prevent myApacheRsc from running on c001n03 - expanded version
-------
<rsc_location id="dont-run-apache-on-c001n03" rsc="myApacheRsc">
    <rule id="dont-run-apache-rule" score="-INFINITY">
      <expression id="dont-run-apache-expr" attribute="#uname"
        operation="eq" value="c00n03"/>
    </rule>
</rsc_location>
-------

The advantage of using the expanded form is that one can then add
extra clauses to the rule, such as limiting the rule such that it only
applies during certain times of the day or days of the week (this is
discussed in subsequent sections).


It also allows us to match on node properties other than its name.  If
we rated each machine's CPU power such that the cluster had the
following nodes section:

.A sample nodes section for use with score-attribute 
-------
<nodes>
   <node id="uuid1" uname="c001n01" type="normal">
      <instance_attributes id="uuid1-custom_attrs">
        <nvpair id="uuid1-cpu_mips" name="cpu_mips" value="1234"/>
      </instance_attributes>
   </node>
   <node id="uuid2" uname="c001n02" type="normal">
      <instance_attributes id="uuid2-custom_attrs">
        <nvpair id="uuid2-cpu_mips" name="cpu_mips" value="5678"/>
      </instance_attributes>
   </node>
</nodes>
-------

then we could prevent resources from running on underpowered machines with the rule

[source,XML]
-------
<rule id="need-more-power-rule" score="-INFINITY">
   <expression id=" need-more-power-expr" attribute="cpu_mips"
               operation="lt" value="3000"/>
</rule>
-------

=== Using +score-attribute+ Instead of +score+ ===

When using +score-attribute+ instead of +score+, each node matched by
the rule has its score adjusted differently, according to its value
for the named node attribute.  Thus, in the previous example, if a
rule used +score-attribute="cpu_mips"+, +c001n01+ would have its
preference to run the resource increased by +1234+ whereas +c001n02+
would have its preference increased by +5678+.

== Using Rules to Control Resource Options ==

Often some cluster nodes will be different from their peers; sometimes
these differences (the location of a binary or the names of network
interfaces) require resources to be configured differently depending
on the machine they're hosted on.

By defining multiple +instance_attributes+ objects for the resource
and adding a rule to each, we can easily handle these special cases.

In the example below, +mySpecialRsc+ will use eth1 and port 9999 when
run on +node1+, eth2 and port 8888 on +node2+ and default to eth0 and
port 9999 for all other nodes.

.Defining different resource options based on the node name
-------
<primitive id="mySpecialRsc" class="ocf" type="Special" provider="me">
   <instance_attributes id="special-node1" score="3">
    <rule id="node1-special-case" score="INFINITY" >
     <expression id="node1-special-case-expr" attribute="#uname"
       operation="eq" value="node1"/>
    </rule>
    <nvpair id="node1-interface" name="interface" value="eth1"/>
   </instance_attributes>
   <instance_attributes id="special-node2" score="2" >
    <rule id="node2-special-case" score="INFINITY">
     <expression id="node2-special-case-expr" attribute="#uname"
       operation="eq" value="node2"/>
    </rule>
    <nvpair id="node2-interface" name="interface" value="eth2"/>
    <nvpair id="node2-port" name="port" value="8888"/>
   </instance_attributes>
   <instance_attributes id="defaults" score="1" >
    <nvpair id="default-interface" name="interface" value="eth0"/>
    <nvpair id="default-port" name="port" value="9999"/>
   </instance_attributes>
</primitive>
-------

The order in which +instance_attributes+ objects are evaluated is
determined by their score (highest to lowest).  If not supplied, score
defaults to zero and objects with an equal score are processed in
listed order.  If the +instance_attributes+ object does not have a
+rule+ or has a +rule+ that evaluates to +true+, then for any
parameter the resource does not yet have a value for, the resource
will use the parameter values defined by the +instance_attributes+
object.

== Using Rules to Control Cluster Options ==
indexterm:[Rule,Controlling Cluster Options]
indexterm:[Cluster Options,Controlled by Rules]

Controlling cluster options is achieved in much the same manner as
specifying different resource options on different nodes.

The difference is that because they are cluster options, one cannot
(or should not, because they won't work) use attribute based
expressions.  The following example illustrates how to set a different
+resource-stickiness+ value during and outside of work hours.  This
allows resources to automatically move back to their most preferred
hosts, but at a time that (in theory) does not interfere with business
activities.

.Change +resource-stickiness+ during working hours
-------
<rsc_defaults>
   <meta_attributes id="core-hours" score="2">
      <rule id="core-hour-rule" score="0">
        <date_expression id="nine-to-five-Mon-to-Fri" operation="date_spec">
          <date_spec id="nine-to-five-Mon-to-Fri-spec" hours="9-16" weekdays="1-5"/>
        </date_expression>
      </rule>
      <nvpair id="core-stickiness" name="resource-stickiness" value="INFINITY"/>
   </meta_attributes>
   <meta_attributes id="after-hours" score="1" >
      <nvpair id="after-stickiness" name="resource-stickiness" value="0"/>
   </meta_attributes>
</rsc_defaults>
-------

== Ensuring Time Based Rules Take Effect ==

anchor:s-rules-recheck[Ensuring Time Based Rules Take Effect]
A Pacemaker cluster is an event driven system.  As such, it won't
recalculate the best place for resources to run in unless something
(like a resource failure or configuration change) happens.  This can
mean that a location constraint that only allows resource X to run
between 9am and 5pm is not enforced.

If you rely on time based rules, it is essential that you set the
+cluster-recheck-interval+ option.  This tells the cluster to
periodically recalculate the ideal state of the cluster.  For example,
if you set +cluster-recheck-interval=5m+, then sometime between 9:00
and 9:05 the cluster would notice that it needs to start resource X,
and between 17:00 and 17:05 it would realize that X needed to be
stopped.

Note that the timing of the actual start and stop actions depends on
what else needs to be performed first.
