        Groups - A Syntactic Shortcut</title>
      <para>
        One of the most common elements of a cluster is a set of resources that need to be located together, start sequentially, and stop in the reverse order.
        To simplify this configuration we support the concept of groups.
      </para>
      <example>
        <title>An example group</title>
        <programlisting><![CDATA[ <group id="shortcut">
   <primitive id="Public-IP" class="ocf" type="IPaddr" provider="heartbeat">
    <instance_attributes id="params-public-ip">
       <nvpair id="public-ip-addr" name="ip" value="1.2.3.4"/>
    </instance_attributes>
   </primitive>
   <primitive id="Email" class="lsb" type="exim"/>
  </group> ]]> </programlisting>
      </example>
      <para>
        Although the example above contains only two resources, there is no limit to the number of resources a group can contain.
        The example is also sufficient to explain the fundamental properties of a group:
      </para>
      <itemizedlist spacing="compact">
        <listitem><para>Resources are started in the order they appear in (<literal>Public-IP</literal> first, then <literal>Email</literal>)</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Resources are stopped in the reverse order to which they appear in (<literal>Email</literal> first, then <literal>Public-IP</literal>)</para></listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>If a resource in the group can't run anywhere, then nothing after that is allowed to run, too.
            <itemizedlist spacing="compact">
              <listitem><para>If <literal>Public-IP</literal> can't run anywhere, neither can <literal>Email</literal>;</para></listitem>
              <listitem><para>but if <literal>Email</literal> can't run anywhere, this does not affect <literal>Public-IP</literal> in any way</para></listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>The group above is logically equivalent to writing:</para>
      <example>
        <title>How the cluster sees a group resource</title>
        <programlisting><![CDATA[ <configuration>
   <resources>

     <instance_attributes id="params-public-ip">

      <rsc_order id="yyy" first="Public-IP" then="Email"/>
   </constraints>
  </configuration> ]]> </programlisting>
      </example>
      <para>Obviously as the group grows bigger, the reduced configuration effort can become significant.</para>
      <para>Another (typical) example of a group is a DRBD volume, the filesystem mount, an IP address, and an application that uses them.</para>

          <para>Stickiness, the measure of how much a resource wants to stay where it is, is additive in groups.
            Every active resource of the group will contribute its stickiness value to the group's total.
            So if the default <literal>resource-stickiness</literal> is 100, and a group has seven members, five of which are active, then the group as a whole will prefer its current location with a score of 500.</para>

        Clones - Resources That Get Active on Multiple Hosts</title>
      <para>
        Clones were initially conceived as a convenient way to start N instances of an IP resource and have them distributed throughout the cluster for load balancing.
        They have turned out to quite useful for a number of purposes including integrating with Red Hat's DLM, the fencing subsystem, and OCFS2.
      </para>
      <para>You can clone any resource, provided the resource agent supports it.</para>
      <para>Three types of cloned resources exist:
      <itemizedlist spacing="compact">
        <listitem><para>Anonymous</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Globally Unique</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Stateful</para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist></para>
      <para>
        Anonymous clones are the simplest type.
        These resources behave completely identically everywhere they are running.
        Because of this, there can only be one copy of an anonymous clone active per machine.
      </para>
      <para>
        Globally unique clones are distinct entities.
        A copy of the clone running on one machine is not equivalent to another instance on another node.
        Nor would any two copies on the same node be equivalent.
      </para>

          <title>Constraints</title>
          <para>
            In most cases, a clone will have a single copy on each active cluster node.
            If this is not the case, you can indicate which nodes the cluster should preferentially assign copies to with resource location constraints.
            These constraints are written no differently to those for regular resources except that the clone's id is used.
          </para>
          <para>
            Ordering constraints behave slightly differently for clones.
            In the example below, <literal>apache-stats</literal> will wait until all copies of the clone that need to be started have done so before being started itself.
            Only if <emphasis>no</emphasis> copies can be started <literal>apache-stats</literal> will be prevented from being active.
            Additionally, the clone will wait for <literal>apache-stats</literal> to be stopped before stopping the clone.
          </para>
          <para>
            Colocation of a regular (or group) resource with a clone means that the resource can run on any machine with an active copy of the clone.
            The cluster will choose a copy based on where the clone is running and the resource's own location preferences.
          </para>
          <para>
            Colocation between clones is also possible.
            In such cases, the set of allowed locations for the clone is limited to nodes on which the clone is (or will be) active.
            Allocation is then performed as normally.

            To achieve a stable allocation pattern, clones are slightly sticky by default.
            If no value for <literal>resource-stickiness</literal> is provided, the clone will use a value of 1.
            Being a small value, it causes minimal disturbance to the score calculations of other resources but is enough to prevent Pacemaker from needlessly moving copies around the cluster.

          <title>Resource Agent Requirements</title>
          <para>
            Any resource can be used as an anonymous clone, as it requires no additional support from the resource agent.
            Whether it makes sense to do so depends on your resource and its resource agent.
          </para>
          <para>
            Globally unique clones do require some additional support in the resource agent.
            In particular, it must only respond with <envar>${OCF_SUCCESS}</envar> if the node has that exact instance active.
            All other probes for instances of the clone should result in <envar>${OCF_NOT_RUNNING}</envar>.
            Unless of course they are failed, in which case they should return one of the other OCF error codes.

        Multi-state - Resources That Have Multiple Modes</title>
      <para>
        Multi-state resources are a specialization of Clone resources; please ensure you understand the section on clones before continuing! They allow the instances to be in one of two operating modes;
        these are called <literal>Master</literal> and <literal>Slave</literal>, but can mean whatever you wish them to mean.
        The only limitation is that when an instance is started, it must come up in the <literal>Slave</literal> state.

          <title>Monitoring Multi-State Resources</title>
          <para>
            The normal type of monitor actions are not sufficient to monitor a multi-state resource in the <literal>Master</literal> state.
            To detect failures of the <literal>Master</literal> instance, you need to define an additional monitor action with <literal>role="Master"</literal>.
          </para>
          <important><para>It is crucial that <emphasis>every</emphasis> monitor operation has a different interval!</para>
            <para>This is because Pacemaker currently differentiates between operations only by resource and interval; so if eg. a master/slave resource has the same monitor interval for both roles, Pacemaker would ignore the role when checking the status - which would cause unexpected return codes, and therefore unnecessary complications.</para></important>

          <title>Constraints</title>
          <para>
            In most cases, a multi-state resources will have a single copy on each active cluster node.
            If this is not the case, you can indicate which nodes the cluster should preferentially assign copies to with resource location constraints.
            These constraints are written no differently to those for regular resources except that the master's id is used.
          </para>
          <para>
            When considering multi-state resources in constraints, for most purposes it is sufficient to treat them as clones.
            The exception is when the <literal>rsc-role</literal> and/or <literal>with-rsc-role</literal> fields (for colocation constraints) and <literal>first-action</literal> and/or <literal>then-action</literal> fields (for ordering constraints) are used.

            In the example below, <literal>myApp</literal> will wait until one of the database copies has been started and promoted to master before being started itself.
            Only if no copies can be promoted will <literal>apache-stats</literal> be prevented from being active.

            Colocation of a regular (or group) resource with a multi-state resource means that it can run on any machine with an active copy of the multi-state resource that is in the specified state (<literal>Master</literal> or <literal>Slave</literal>).
            In the example, the cluster will choose a location based on where database is running as a <literal>Master</literal>, and if there are multiple <literal>Master</literal> instances it will also factor in <literal>myApp</literal>'s own location preferences when deciding which location to choose.
          </para>
          <para>
            Colocation with regular clones and other multi-state resources is also possible.
            In such cases, the set of allowed locations for the <literal>rsc</literal> clone is (after role filtering) limited to nodes on which the <literal>with-rsc</literal> multi-state resource is (or will be) in the specified role.
            Allocation is then performed as-per-normal.

            To achieve a stable allocation pattern, multi-state resources are slightly sticky by default.
            If no value for <literal>resource-stickiness</literal> is provided, the multi-state resource will use a value of 1.
            Being a small value, it causes minimal disturbance to the score calculations of other resources but is enough to prevent Pacemaker from needlessly moving copies around the cluster.

          <title>Which Resource Instance is Promoted</title>

            During the start operation, most Resource Agent scripts should call the <command>crm_master</command> utility.
            This tool automatically detects both the resource and host and should be used to set a preference for being promoted.
            Based on this, <literal>master-max</literal>, and <literal>master-node-max</literal>, the instance(s) with the highest preference will be promoted.
          </para>

          <title>Resource Agent Requirements</title>
          <para>
            Since multi-state resources are an extension of cloned resources, all the requirements of Clones are also requirements of multi-state resources.
            Additionally, multi-state resources require two extra actions: <literal>demote</literal> and <literal>promote</literal>;
            these actions are responsible for changing the state of the resource.
            Like <literal>start</literal> and <literal>stop</literal>, they should return <envar>OCF_SUCCESS</envar> if they completed successfully or a relevant error code if they did not.
          </para>
          <para>
            The states can mean whatever you wish, but when the resource is started, it must come up in the mode called <literal>Slave</literal>.
            From there the cluster will then decide which instances to promote to <literal>Master</literal>.
          </para>
          <para>
            In addition to the Clone requirements for monitor actions, agents must also <emphasis>accurately</emphasis> report which state they are in.
            The cluster relies on the agent to report its status (including role) accurately and does not indicate to the agent what role it currently believes it to be in.
