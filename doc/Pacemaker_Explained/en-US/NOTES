2.3.1 editing CIB copy via VI: isn't that racy? Are concurrent changes detected?

why sometimes <example> and sometimes <figure>? examples have title at top, figures have title at bottom

Example 2.8 (and others) XML line too long, line broken

some <command> are in <para>, some in <programlisting> ... I'd like the latter more, or perhaps in a <screen>.
Indentation makes whitespace at start of lines ... remove?

tables 3.1 and 3.2 incomplete (crm-feature-set, ...)

Ch 7 missing?

Remove Ex9.9?

Ap-Debug.xml not used?

<indexterm> alias for primary?
