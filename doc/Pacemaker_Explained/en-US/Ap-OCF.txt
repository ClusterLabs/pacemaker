== More About OCF Resource Agents ==

=== Location of Custom Scripts ===

indexterm:[OCF Resource Agents]
OCF Resource Agents are found in +/usr/lib/ocf/resource.d/pass:[<replaceable>provider</replaceable>]+

When creating your own agents, you are encouraged to create a new
directory under +/usr/lib/ocf/resource.d/+ so that they are not
confused with (or overwritten by) the agents shipped by existing providers.

So, for example, if you choose the provider name of bigCorp and want
a new resource named bigApp, you would create a resource agent called
+/usr/lib/ocf/resource.d/bigCorp/bigApp+ and define a resource:
 
[source,XML]
----
<primitive id="custom-app" class="ocf" provider="bigCorp" type="bigApp"/>
----

=== Actions ===

All OCF resource agents are required to implement the following actions.

.Required Actions for OCF Agents
[width="95%",cols="3m,3,7",options="header",align="center"]
|=========================================================
|Action
|Description
|Instructions

|start
|Start the resource
|Return 0 on success and an appropriate error code otherwise. Must not
 report success until the resource is fully active.
 indexterm:[start,OCF Action]
 indexterm:[OCF,Action,start]

|stop
|Stop the resource
|Return 0 on success and an appropriate error code otherwise. Must not
 report success until the resource is fully stopped.
 indexterm:[stop,OCF Action]
 indexterm:[OCF,Action,stop]

|monitor
|Check the resource's state 

|Exit 0 if the resource is running, 7 if it is stopped, and anything
 else if it is failed. 
 indexterm:[monitor,OCF Action]
 indexterm:[OCF,Action,monitor]

NOTE: The monitor script should test the state of the resource on the local machine only.

|meta-data
|Describe the resource
|Provide information about this resource as an XML snippet. Exit with 0.
 indexterm:[meta-data,OCF Action]
 indexterm:[OCF,Action,meta-data]

NOTE: This is _not_ performed as root.

|validate-all
|Verify the supplied parameters
|Exit with 0 if parameters are valid, 2 if not valid, 6 if resource is not configured.
 indexterm:[validate-all,OCF Action]
 indexterm:[OCF,Action,validate-all]

|=========================================================

Additional requirements (not part of the OCF specs) are placed on
agents that will be used for advanced concepts like
<<s-resource-clone,clones>> and <<s-resource-multistate,multi-state>> resources.

.Optional Actions for OCF Agents
[width="95%",cols="2m,6,3",options="header",align="center"]
|=========================================================

|Action
|Description
|Instructions

|promote
|Promote the local instance of a multi-state resource to the master/primary state.
|Return 0 on success
 indexterm:[promote,OCF Action]
 indexterm:[OCF,Action,promote]

|demote
|Demote the local instance of a multi-state resource to the slave/secondary state.
|Return 0 on success
 indexterm:[demote,OCF Action]
 indexterm:[OCF,Action,demote]

|notify
|Used by the cluster to send the agent pre and post notification
 events telling the resource what has happened and will happen.
|Must not fail. Must exit with 0
 indexterm:[notify,OCF Action]
 indexterm:[OCF,Action,notify]

|=========================================================

One action specified in the OCF specs is not currently used by the cluster:

* +recover+ - a variant of the +start+ action, this should try to
  recover a resource locally.

Remember to use indexterm:[ocf-tester]`ocf-tester` to verify that your
new agent complies with the OCF standard properly.

=== How are OCF Return Codes Interpreted? ===

The first thing the cluster does is to check the return code against
the expected result.  If the result does not match the expected value,
then the operation is considered to have failed, and recovery action is
initiated.

There are three types of failure recovery:

.Types of recovery performed by the cluster
[width="95%",cols="1m,4,4",options="header",align="center"]
|=========================================================

|Type
|Description
|Action Taken by the Cluster

|soft
|A transient error occurred
|Restart the resource or move it to a new location
indexterm:[soft,OCF error]
indexterm:[OCF,error,soft]

|hard
|A non-transient error that may be specific to the current node occurred
|Move the resource elsewhere and prevent it from being retried on the current node
indexterm:[hard,OCF error]
indexterm:[OCF,error,hard]

|fatal
|A non-transient error that will be common to all cluster nodes (e.g. a bad configuration was specified)
|Stop the resource and prevent it from being started on any cluster node
indexterm:[fatal,OCF error]
indexterm:[OCF,error,fatal]

|=========================================================

Assuming an action is considered to have failed, the following table
outlines the different OCF return codes and the type of recovery the
cluster will initiate when it is received.

=== OCF Return Codes ===

.OCF Return Codes and their Recovery Types
[width="95%",cols="1m,4<m,6<,1m",options="header",align="center"]
|=========================================================

|RC
|OCF Alias
|Description
|RT

|0
|OCF_SUCCESS
|Success. The command completed successfully. This is the expected result for all start, stop, promote and demote commands.
indexterm:[Return Code,OCF_SUCCESS]
indexterm:[Return Code,0,OCF_SUCCESS]
|soft

|1
|OCF_ERR_GENERIC
|Generic "there was a problem" error code.
indexterm:[Return Code,OCF_ERR_GENERIC]
indexterm:[Return Code,1,OCF_ERR_GENERIC]
|soft

|2
|OCF_ERR_ARGS
|The resource's configuration is not valid on this machine. E.g. it refers to a location not found on the node. 
indexterm:[Return Code,OCF_ERR_ARGS]
indexterm:[Return Code,2,OCF_ERR_ARGS]
|hard

|3
|OCF_ERR_UNIMPLEMENTED
|The requested action is not implemented.
indexterm:[Return Code,OCF_ERR_UNIMPLEMENTED]
indexterm:[Return Code,3,OCF_ERR_UNIMPLEMENTED]
|hard

|4
|OCF_ERR_PERM
|The resource agent does not have sufficient privileges to complete the task.
indexterm:[Return Code,OCF_ERR_PERM]
indexterm:[Return Code,4,OCF_ERR_PERM]
|hard

|5
|OCF_ERR_INSTALLED
|The tools required by the resource are not installed on this machine.
indexterm:[Return Code,OCF_ERR_INSTALLED]
indexterm:[Return Code,5,OCF_ERR_INSTALLED]
|hard

|6
|OCF_ERR_CONFIGURED
|The resource's configuration is invalid. E.g. required parameters are missing.
indexterm:[Return Code,OCF_ERR_CONFIGURED]
indexterm:[Return Code,6,OCF_ERR_CONFIGURED]
|fatal

|7
|OCF_NOT_RUNNING
|The resource is safely stopped. The cluster will not attempt to stop a resource that returns this for any action.
indexterm:[Return Code,OCF_NOT_RUNNING]
indexterm:[Return Code,7,OCF_NOT_RUNNING]
|N/A

|8
|OCF_RUNNING_MASTER
|The resource is running in +Master+ mode.
indexterm:[Return Code,OCF_RUNNING_MASTER]
indexterm:[Return Code,8,OCF_RUNNING_MASTER]
|soft

|9
|OCF_FAILED_MASTER
|The resource is in +Master+ mode but has failed. The resource will be demoted, stopped and then started (and possibly promoted) again.
indexterm:[Return Code,OCF_FAILED_MASTER]
indexterm:[Return Code,9,OCF_FAILED_MASTER]
|soft

|other
|NA
|Custom error code.
indexterm:[Return Code,other]
|soft

|=========================================================

Although counterintuitive, even actions that return 0
(aka. +OCF_SUCCESS+) can be considered to have failed.

=== Exceptions ===

* Non-recurring monitor actions (probes) that find a resource active
  (or in Master mode) will not result in recovery action unless it is
  also found active elsewhere
* The recovery action taken when a resource is found active more than
  once is determined by the _multiple-active_ property of the resource
* Recurring actions that return +OCF_ERR_UNIMPLEMENTED+
  do not cause any type of recovery
