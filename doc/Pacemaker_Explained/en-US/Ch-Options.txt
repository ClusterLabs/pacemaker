== Special Options ==

indexterm:[Special Cluster Options]
indexterm:[Cluster Options,Special Options]

The reason for these fields to be placed at the top level instead of
with the rest of cluster options is simply a matter of parsing.  These
options are used by the configuration database which is, by design,
mostly ignorant of the content it holds.  So the decision was made to
place them in an easy to find location.
      
== Configuration Version ==

indexterm:[Configuration Version, Cluster Option]
indexterm:[Cluster Options,Configuration Version]

When a node joins the cluster, the cluster will perform a check to see
who has the best configuration based on the fields below.  It then
asks the node with the highest (+admin_epoch+, +epoch+, +num_updates+)
tuple to replace the configuration on all the nodes - which makes
setting them, and setting them correctly, very important.

.Configuration Version Properties
[width="95%",cols="1m,5<",options="header",align="center"]
|=========================================================
|Field |Description

| admin_epoch |
indexterm:[admin_epoch Cluster Option]
indexterm:[Cluster Options,admin_epoch]
Never modified by the cluster. Use this to make the configurations on
any inactive nodes obsolete.

_Never set this value to zero_, in such cases the cluster cannot tell
the difference between your configuration and the "empty" one used
when nothing is found on disk.

| epoch | 
indexterm:[epoch Cluster Option]
indexterm:[Cluster Options,epoch]
Incremented every time the configuration is updated (usually by the admin)

| num_updates |
indexterm:[num_updates Cluster Option]
indexterm:[Cluster Options,num_updates]
Incremented every time the configuration or status is updated (usually by the cluster)
  
|=========================================================

== Other Fields ==
.Properties Controlling Validation
[width="95%",cols="1m,5<",options="header",align="center"]
|=========================================================
|Field |Description
      
| validate-with |
indexterm:[validate-with Cluster Option]
indexterm:[Cluster Options,validate-with]
Determines the type of validation being done on the configuration.  If
set to "none", the cluster will not verify that updates conform to the
DTD (nor reject ones that don't). This option can be useful when
operating a mixed version cluster during an upgrade.

== Fields Maintained by the Cluster ==

.Properties Maintained by the Cluster
[width="95%",cols="1m,5<",options="header",align="center"]
|=========================================================
|Field |Description

|cib-last-written | 
indexterm:[cib-last-written Cluster Fields]
indexterm:[Cluster Fields,cib-last-written]
Indicates when the configuration was last written to disk. Informational purposes only.

|dc-uuid |
indexterm:[dc-uuid Cluster Fields]
indexterm:[Cluster Fields,dc-uuid]
Indicates which cluster node is the current leader. Used by the
cluster when placing resources and determining the order of some
events.

|have-quorum |
indexterm:[have-quorum Cluster Fields]
indexterm:[Cluster Fields,have-quorum]
Indicates if the cluster has quorum. If false, this may mean that the
cluster cannot start resources or fence other nodes. See
+no-quorum-policy+ below.
  
|=========================================================

Note that although these fields can be written to by the admin, in
most cases the cluster will overwrite any values specified by the
admin with the "correct" ones.  To change the +admin_epoch+, for
example, one would use:

pass:[<command>cibadmin --modify --crm_xml ‘&lt;cib admin_epoch="42"/>'</command>]

A complete set of fields will look something like this:

.An example of the fields set for a cib object
[source,XML]
-------
<cib have-quorum="true" validate-with="pacemaker-1.0"
  admin_epoch="1" epoch="12" num_updates="65"
  dc-uuid="ea7d39f4-3b94-4cfa-ba7a-952956daabee">

== Cluster Options ==

Cluster options, as you might expect, control how the cluster behaves
when confronted with certain situations.

They are grouped into sets and, in advanced configurations, there may
be more than one.
footnote:[This will be described later in the section on
<<ch-rules>> where we will show how to have the cluster use
different sets of options during working hours (when downtime is
usually to be avoided at all costs) than it does during the weekends
(when resources can be moved to the their preferred hosts without
bothering end users)]
For now we will describe the simple case where each option is present at most once.

== Available Cluster Options ==

[width="95%",cols="5m,2m,13",options="header",align="center"]
|=========================================================
|Option |Default |Description
      
| batch-limit | 30 |
indexterm:[batch-limit Cluster Options]
indexterm:[Cluster Options,batch-limit]
The number of jobs that the TE is allowed to execute in parallel. The
"correct" value will depend on the speed and load of your network and
cluster nodes.

| migration-limit | -1 (unlimited) |
indexterm:[migration-limit Cluster Options]
indexterm:[Cluster Options,migration-limit]
The number of migration jobs that the TE is allowed to execute in
parallel on a node.

| no-quorum-policy | stop |
indexterm:[no-quorum-policy Cluster Options]
indexterm:[Cluster Options,no-quorum-policy]
What to do when the cluster does not have quorum.  Allowed values:

 * ignore - continue all resource management
 * freeze - continue resource management, but don't recover resources from nodes not in the affected partition
 * stop - stop all resources in the affected cluster partition
 * suicide - fence all nodes in the affected cluster partition

| symmetric-cluster | TRUE | 
indexterm:[symmetric-cluster Cluster Options]
indexterm:[Cluster Options,symmetric-cluster]
Can all resources run on any node by default?

| stonith-enabled | TRUE |
indexterm:[stonith-enabled Cluster Options]
indexterm:[Cluster Options,stonith-enabled]
Should failed nodes and nodes with resources that can't be stopped be
shot? If you value your data, set up a STONITH device and enable this.

If true, or unset, the cluster will refuse to start resources unless
one or more STONITH resources have been configured also.
	
| stonith-action | reboot |
indexterm:[stonith-action Cluster Options]
indexterm:[Cluster Options,stonith-action]
Action to send to STONITH device. Allowed values: reboot, poweroff.

| cluster-delay | 60s |
indexterm:[cluster-delay Cluster Options]
indexterm:[Cluster Options,cluster-delay]
Round trip delay over the network (excluding action execution). The
"correct" value will depend on the speed and load of your network and
cluster nodes.

| stop-orphan-resources | TRUE |
indexterm:[stop-orphan-resources Cluster Options]
indexterm:[Cluster Options,stop-orphan-resources]
Should deleted resources be stopped?

| stop-orphan-actions | TRUE | 
indexterm:[stop-orphan-actions Cluster Options]
indexterm:[Cluster Options,stop-orphan-actions]
Should deleted actions be cancelled?

| start-failure-is-fatal | TRUE | 
indexterm:[start-failure-is-fatal Cluster Options]
indexterm:[Cluster Options,start-failure-is-fatal]
When set to FALSE, the cluster will instead use the resource's
+failcount+ and value for +resource-failure-stickiness+.

| pe-error-series-max | -1 (all) | 
indexterm:[pe-error-series-max Cluster Options]
indexterm:[Cluster Options,pe-error-series-max]
The number of PE inputs resulting in ERRORs to save. Used when reporting problems.

| pe-warn-series-max | -1 (all) | 
indexterm:[pe-warn-series-max Cluster Options]
indexterm:[Cluster Options,pe-warn-series-max]
The number of PE inputs resulting in WARNINGs to save. Used when reporting problems.

| pe-input-series-max | -1 (all) |
indexterm:[pe-input-series-max Cluster Options]
indexterm:[Cluster Options,pe-input-series-max]
The number of "normal" PE inputs to save. Used when reporting problems.
  
|=========================================================

You can always obtain an up-to-date list of cluster options, including
their default values, by running the pass:[<command>pengine
metadata</command>] command.

== Querying and Setting Cluster Options ==

indexterm:[Querying Cluster Options]
indexterm:[Setting Cluster Options]
indexterm:[Cluster Options,Querying]
indexterm:[Cluster Options,Setting]

Cluster options can be queried and modified using the
pass:[<command>crm_attribute</command>] tool.  To get the current
value of +cluster-delay+, simply use:

pass:[<command>crm_attribute --attr-name cluster-delay --get-value</command>]

which is more simply written as

pass:[<command>crm_attribute --get-value -n cluster-delay</command>]

If a value is found, you'll see a result like this:
=======
pass:[<command> # crm_attribute --get-value -n cluster-delay</command>]

 name=cluster-delay value=60s
========

However, if no value is found, the tool will display an error:
=======
pass:[<command># crm_attribute --get-value -n clusta-deway</command>]

 name=clusta-deway value=(null)
 Error performing operation: The object/attribute does not exist
========

To use a different value, eg. +30+, simply run:

pass:[<command>crm_attribute --attr-name cluster-delay --attr-value 30s</command>]

To go back to the cluster's default value you can delete the value, for example with this command:

pass:[<command>crm_attribute --attr-name cluster-delay --delete-attr</command>]

== When Options are Listed More Than Once ==

If you ever see something like the following, it means that the option you're modifying is present more than once.

.Deleting an option that is listed twice
=======
pass:[<command># crm_attribute --attr-name batch-limit --delete-attr</command>]

 Multiple attributes match name=batch-limit in crm_config:
 Value: 50          (set=cib-bootstrap-options, id=cib-bootstrap-options-batch-limit)
 Value: 100         (set=custom, id=custom-batch-limit)
 Please choose from one of the matches above and supply the 'id' with --attr-id
=======

In such cases follow the on-screen instructions to perform the
requested action.  To determine which value is currently being used by
the cluster, please refer to the section on <<ch-rules>>.
