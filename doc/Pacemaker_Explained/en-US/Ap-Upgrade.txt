== Upgrading Cluster Software

=== Version Compatibility ===

When releasing newer versions we take care to make sure we are
backwards compatible with older versions. While you will always be
able to upgrade from version x to x+1, in order to continue to produce
high quality software it may occasionally be necessary to drop
compatibility with older versions.

There will always be an upgrade path from any series-2 release to any
other series-2 release.

There are three approaches to upgrading your cluster software:

* Complete Cluster Shutdown
* Rolling (node by node)
* Disconnect and Reattach

Each method has advantages and disadvantages, some of which are listed
in the table below, and you should chose the one most appropriate to
your needs.

newer version is also supported.

|=========================================================

=== Complete Cluster Shutdown ===

In this scenario one shuts down all cluster nodes and resources and
upgrades all the nodes before restarting the cluster.

==== Procedure ====
. On each node:
.. Shutdown the cluster stack (Heartbeat or Corosync)
.. Upgrade the Pacemaker software.
   This may also include upgrading the cluster stack and/or the
   underlying operating system.
.. Check the configuration manually or with the `crm_verify` tool if available.
. On each node:
.. Start the cluster stack.
   This can be either Corosync or Heartbeat and does not need to be
   the same as the previous cluster stack.

=== Rolling (node by node) ===

In this scenario each node is removed from the cluster, upgraded and then brought back online until all nodes are running the newest version.

[IMPORTANT]
===========
This method is currently broken between Pacemaker 0.6.x and 1.0.x.

Measures have been put into place to ensure rolling upgrades always
work for versions after 1.0.0.  Please try one of the other upgrade
strategies.  Detach/Reattach is a particularly good option for most
people.
===========
          
==== Procedure ====

On each node:
. Shutdown the cluster stack (Heartbeat or Corosync)
. Upgrade the Pacemaker software. This may also include upgrading the
  cluster stack and/or the underlying operating system.
.. On the first node, check the configuration manually or with the
   `crm_verify` tool if available.
.. Start the cluster stack.
+
This must be the same type of cluster stack (Corosync or Heartbeat)
that the rest of the cluster is using.  Upgrading Corosync/Heartbeat
may also be possible, please consult the documentation for those
projects to see if the two versions will be compatible.
+
.. Repeat for each node in the cluster.

==== Version Compatibility ====

|=========================================================

|Version being Installed
|Oldest Compatible Version

|Pacemaker 1.0.x
|Pacemaker 1.0.0

|Pacemaker 0.7.x
|Pacemaker 0.6 or Heartbeat 2.1.3

|Pacemaker 0.6.x
|Heartbeat 2.0.8

|Heartbeat 2.1.3 (or less)
|Heartbeat 2.0.4

|Heartbeat 2.0.4 (or less)
|Heartbeat 2.0.0

|Heartbeat 2.0.0
|None. Use an alternate upgrade strategy.

|=========================================================

==== Crossing Compatibility Boundaries ====

Rolling upgrades that cross compatibility boundaries must be preformed
in multiple steps. For example, to perform a rolling update from
Heartbeat 2.0.1 to Pacemaker 0.6.6 one must:

. Perform a rolling upgrade from Heartbeat 2.0.1 to Heartbeat 2.0.4 
. Perform a rolling upgrade from Heartbeat 2.0.4 to Heartbeat 2.1.3
. Perform a rolling upgrade from Heartbeat 2.1.3 to Pacemaker 0.6.6

=== Disconnect and Reattach ===

A variant of a complete cluster shutdown, but the resources are left
active and get re-detected when the cluster is restarted.

==== Procedure ====

. Tell the cluster to stop managing services.
+
This is required to allow the services to remain active after the
cluster shuts down.
+
[source,C]
# crm_attribute -t crm_config -n is-managed-default -v false
+
. For any resource that has a value for +is-managed+, make sure it is
set to +false+ (so that the cluster will not stop it)
+
[source,C]
# crm_resource -t primitive -r $rsc_id -p is-managed -v false
+
. On each node:
.. Shutdown the cluster stack (Heartbeat or Corosync)
.. Upgrade the cluster stack program - This may also include upgrading
the underlying operating system.
. Check the configuration manually or with the `crm_verify` tool if available.
. On each node:
.. Start the cluster stack.
+
This can be either Corosync or Heartbeat and does not need to be the
same as the previous cluster stack.
+
. Verify that the cluster re-detected all resources correctly.
. Allow the cluster to resume managing resources again:
+
[source,C]
# crm_attribute -t crm_config -n is-managed-default -v true
+
. For any resource that has a value for +is-managed+ reset it to
  +true+ (so the cluster can recover the service if it fails) if
  desired:
+
[source,C]
# crm_resource -t primitive -r $rsc_id -p is-managed -v true


==== Notes ====

[IMPORTANT]
===========
Always check your existing configuration is still compatible with the
version you are installing before starting the cluster.

[NOTE]
The oldest version of the CRM to support this upgrade type was in Heartbeat 2.0.4
