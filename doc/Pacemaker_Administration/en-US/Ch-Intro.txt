== The Scope of this Document ==

The purpose of this document is to help system administrators learn how to
manage a Pacemaker cluster.
      
System administrators may be interested in other parts of the
https://www.clusterlabs.org/pacemaker/doc/[Pacemaker documentation set],
such as 'Clusters from Scratch', a step-by-step guide to setting up an
example cluster, and 'Pacemaker Explained', an exhaustive reference for
cluster configuration.

Multiple higher-level tools (both command-line and GUI) are available to
simplify cluster management. However, this document focuses on the lower-level
command-line tools that come with Pacemaker itself. The concepts are applicable
to the higher-level tools, though the syntax would differ.
