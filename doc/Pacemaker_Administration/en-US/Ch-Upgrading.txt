= Upgrading a Pacemaker Cluster =

== Pacemaker Versioning ==

Pacemaker has an overall release version, plus separate version numbers for
certain internal components.

* *Pacemaker release version:* This version consists of three numbers
  (_x.y.z_).
+
The major version number (the _x_ in _x.y.z_) increases when at least some
rolling upgrades are not possible from the previous major version. For example,
a rolling upgrade from 1.0.8 to 1.1.15 should always be supported, but a
rolling upgrade from 1.0.8 to 2.0.0 may not be possible.
+
The minor version (the _y_ in _x.y.z_) increases when there are significant
changes in cluster default behavior, tool behavior, and/or the API interface
(for software that utilizes Pacemaker libraries). The main benefit is to alert
you to pay closer attention to the release notes, to see if you might be
affected.
+
The release counter (the _z_ in _x.y.z_) is increased with all public releases
of Pacemaker, which typically include both bug fixes and new features.

* *CRM feature set:* This version number applies to the communication between
  full cluster nodes.
+
It increases when a cluster node running the older version would have
problems if the cluster's Designated Controller (DC) has the newer version.
To avoid these problems, Pacemaker ensures that the longest-running node is the
DC, and that nodes with an older feature set cannot join the cluster.

* *LRMD protocol version:* This version applies to communication between a
  Pacemaker Remote node and the cluster. It increases when an older cluster
  node would have problems hosting the connection to a newer Pacemaker Remote
  node. To avoid these problems, Pacemaker Remote nodes will accept connections
  only from cluster nodes with the same or newer LRMD protocol version.
+
Unlike with CRM feature set differences between full cluster nodes,
mixed LRMD protocol versions between Pacemaker Remote nodes and full cluster
nodes are fine, as long as the Pacemaker Remote nodes have the older version.
This can be useful, for example, to host a legacy application in an
older operating system version used as a Pacemaker Remote node.

* *XML schema version:* Pacemaker’s configuration syntax — what's allowed in
  the Configuration Information Base (CIB) — has its own version. This allows
  the configuration syntax to evolve over time while still allowing clusters
  with older configurations to work without change.

== Upgrading Cluster Software ==

There are three approaches to upgrading a cluster, each with advantages and
disadvantages.

|=========================================================

=== Complete Cluster Shutdown ===

In this scenario, one shuts down all cluster nodes and resources,
then upgrades all the nodes before restarting the cluster.

. On each node:
.. Shutdown the cluster software (pacemaker and the messaging layer).
.. Upgrade the Pacemaker software. This may also include upgrading the
   messaging layer and/or the underlying operating system.
.. Check the configuration with the `crm_verify` tool.
. On each node:
.. Start the cluster software.
   Currently, only Corosync version 2 and greater is supported as the cluster
   layer, but if another stack is supported in the future, the stack does not
   need to be the same one before the upgrade.

One variation of this approach is to build a new cluster on new hosts.
This allows the new version to be tested beforehand, and minimizes downtime by
having the new nodes ready to be placed in production as soon as the old nodes
are shut down.

=== Rolling (node by node) ===

In this scenario, each node is removed from the cluster, upgraded, and then
brought back online, until all nodes are running the newest version.

Special considerations when planning a rolling upgrade:

* If you plan to upgrade other cluster software -- such as the messaging layer --
  at the same time, consult that software's documentation for its compatibility
  with a rolling upgrade.

* If the major version number is changing in the Pacemaker version you are
  upgrading to, a rolling upgrade may not be possible. Read the new version's
  release notes (as well the information here) for what limitations may exist.

* If the CRM feature set is changing in the Pacemaker version you are upgrading
  to, you should run a mixed-version cluster only during a small rolling
  upgrade window. If one of the older nodes drops out of the cluster for any
  reason, it will not be able to rejoin until it is upgraded.

* If the LRMD protocol version is changing, all cluster nodes should be
  upgraded before upgrading any Pacemaker Remote nodes.

See the ClusterLabs wiki's
http://clusterlabs.org/wiki/ReleaseCalendar[Release Calendar] to figure out
whether the CRM feature set and/or LRMD protocol version changed between the
the Pacemaker release versions in your rolling upgrade.

To perform a rolling upgrade, on each node in turn:

. Put the node into standby mode, and wait for any active resources
  to be moved cleanly to another node. (This step is optional, but
  allows you to deal with any resource issues before the upgrade.)
. Shutdown the cluster software (pacemaker and the messaging layer) on the node.
. Upgrade the Pacemaker software. This may also include upgrading the
  messaging layer and/or the underlying operating system.
. If this is the first node to be upgraded, check the configuration
  with the `crm_verify` tool.
. Start the messaging layer.
  This must be the same messaging layer (currently only Corosync version 2 and
  greater is supported) that the rest of the cluster is using.

[NOTE]
====
Even if a rolling upgrade from the current version of the cluster to the newest
version is not directly possible, it may be possible to perform a rolling
upgrade in multiple steps, by upgrading to an intermediate version first.

.Version Compatibility Table
[width="95%",cols="2*",options="header",align="center"]
|=========================================================

|Version being Installed
|Oldest Compatible Version

|Pacemaker 2.y.z
|Pacemaker 1.1.11
footnote:[Rolling upgrades from Pacemaker 1.1.z to 2.y.z are possible only if
the cluster uses corosync version 2 or greater as its messaging layer, and the
Cluster Information Base (CIB) uses schema 1.0 or higher in its validate-with
property.]

|Pacemaker 1.y.z
|Pacemaker 1.0.0

|Pacemaker 0.7.z
|Pacemaker 0.6.z

|=========================================================
====

=== Detach and Reattach ===

The reattach method is a variant of a complete cluster shutdown, where the
resources are left active and get re-detected when the cluster is restarted.

This method may not be used if the cluster contains any Pacemaker Remote nodes.

. Tell the cluster to stop managing services. This is required to allow the
  services to remain active after the cluster shuts down.
+
----
# crm_attribute --name maintenance-mode --update true
----

. On each node, shutdown the cluster software (pacemaker and the messaging
  layer), and upgrade the Pacemaker software. This may also include upgrading
  the messaging layer. While the underlying operating system may be upgraded
  at the same time, that will be more likely to cause outages in the detached
  services (certainly, if a reboot is required).
. Check the configuration with the `crm_verify` tool.
. On each node, start the cluster software.
  Currently, only Corosync version 2 and greater is supported as the cluster
  layer, but if another stack is supported in the future, the stack does not
  need to be the same one before the upgrade.
. Verify that the cluster re-detected all resources correctly.
. Allow the cluster to resume managing resources again:
+
----
# crm_attribute --name maintenance-mode --delete
----

== Upgrading the Configuration ==

indexterm:[upgrade,Configuration]
indexterm:[Configuration,upgrading]

The CIB schema version can change from one Pacemaker version to another.

After cluster software is upgraded, the cluster will continue to use
the older schema version that it was previously using. This can be useful, for
example, when administrators have written tools that modify the configuration,
and are based on the older syntax.
footnote:[As of Pacemaker 2.0.0, only schema versions pacemaker-1.0 and higher
are supported (excluding pacemaker-1.1, which was an experimental schema
now known as pacemaker-next).]

However, when using an older syntax, new features may be unavailable, and there
is a performance impact, since the cluster must do a non-persistent
configuration upgrade before each transition. So while using the old syntax is
possible, it is not advisable to continue using it indefinitely.

Even if you wish to continue using the old syntax, it is a good idea to
follow the upgrade procedure outlined below, except for the last step, to ensure
that the new software has no problems with your existing configuration (since it
will perform much the same task internally).

If you are brave, it is sufficient simply to run `cibadmin --upgrade`.

A more cautious approach would proceed like this:

. Create a shadow copy of the configuration. The later commands will automatically
  operate on this copy, rather than the live configuration.
+
-----
# crm_shadow --create shadow
-----
. Verify the configuration is valid with the new software (which may be
  stricter about syntax mistakes, or may have dropped support for deprecated
  features):
indexterm:[Configuration,verify]
indexterm:[verify,Configuration]
+
-----
# crm_verify --live-check
-----
. Fix any errors or warnings.
. Perform the upgrade:
+
-----
# cibadmin --upgrade
-----
. If this step fails, there are three main possibilities:
.. The configuration was not valid to start with (did you do steps 2 and 3?).
.. The transformation failed - http://bugs.clusterlabs.org/[report a bug] or
   mailto:users@clusterlabs.org?subject=Transformation%20failed%20during%20upgrade[email the project].
.. The transformation was successful but produced an invalid result.
+
If the result of the transformation is invalid, you may see a number of errors
from the validation library. If these are not helpful, visit the
http://clusterlabs.org/wiki/Validation_FAQ[Validation FAQ wiki page] and/or try
the manual upgrade procedure described below.
+        
. Check the changes:
+
-----
# crm_shadow --diff
-----
+
If at this point there is anything about the upgrade that you wish to fine-tune
(for example, to change some of the automatic IDs), now is the time to do so:
+
-----
# crm_shadow --edit
-----
+
This will open the configuration in your favorite editor (whichever is
specified by the standard *$EDITOR* environment variable).
+
. Preview how the cluster will react:
+
------
# crm_simulate --live-check --save-dotfile shadow.dot -S
# graphviz shadow.dot
------
+
Verify that either no resource actions will occur or that you are
happy with any that are scheduled.  If the output contains actions you
do not expect (possibly due to changes to the score calculations), you
may need to make further manual changes.  See
<<s-config-testing-changes>> for further details on how to interpret
the output of `crm_simulate` and `graphviz`.
+
. Upload the changes:
+
-----
# crm_shadow --commit shadow --force
-----
+
In the unlikely event this step fails, please report a bug.

[NOTE]
====
indexterm:[Configuration,upgrade manually]
It is also possible to perform the configuration upgrade steps manually:

. Locate the +upgrade*.xsl+ conversion scripts provided with the source code. These will often
  be installed in a location such as +/usr/share/pacemaker+, or may be obtained from
  the https://github.com/ClusterLabs/pacemaker/tree/master/xml[source repository].
          
. Run the conversion scripts that apply to your older version, for example:
  indexterm:[XML,convert]
+
-----
# xsltproc /path/to/upgrade06.xsl config06.xml > config10.xml
-----
+          
. Locate the +pacemaker.rng+ script (from the same location as the xsl files).
. Check the XML validity: indexterm:[validate configuration]indexterm:[Configuration,validate XML]
+
----
# xmllint --relaxng /path/to/pacemaker.rng config10.xml
----

The advantage of this method is that it can be performed without the
cluster running, and any validation errors are often more informative.

== What Changed in 2.0 ==

The main goal of the 2.0 release was to remove support for deprecated syntax,
along with some small changes in default configuration behavior and tool
behavior. Highlights:

* Only Corosync version 2 and greater is now supported as the underlying
  cluster layer. Support for Heartbeat and Corosync 1 (including CMAN) is
  removed.

* The Pacemaker detail log file is now stored in
  /var/log/pacemaker/pacemaker.log by default.

* The record-pending cluster property now defaults to true, which
  allows status tools such as crm_mon to show operations that are in
  progress.

* Support for a number of deprecated build options, environment variables,
  and configuration settings has been removed.

* The public API for Pacemaker libraries that software applications can use
  has changed significantly.

For a detailed list of changes, see the release notes and the
https://wiki.clusterlabs.org/wiki/Pacemaker_2.0_Changes[Pacemaker 2.0 Changes]
page on the ClusterLabs wiki.

== What Changed in 1.0 ==

=== New ===

* Failure timeouts.
* New section for resource and operation defaults.
* Tool for making offline configuration changes.
* +Rules, instance_attributes, meta_attributes+ and sets of operations can be defined once and referenced in multiple places.
* The CIB now accepts XPath-based create/modify/delete operations. See the pass:[<command>cibadmin</command>] help text.
* Multi-dimensional colocation and ordering constraints.
* The ability to connect to the CIB from non-cluster machines.
* Allow recurring actions to be triggered at known times.


=== Changed ===

* Syntax
** All resource and cluster options now use dashes (-) instead of underscores (_)
** +master_slave+ was renamed to +master+
** The +attributes+ container tag was removed
** The operation field +pre-req+ has been renamed +requires+
** All operations must have an +interval+, +start+/+stop+ must have it set to zero
* The +stonith-enabled+ option now defaults to true.
* The cluster will refuse to start resources if +stonith-enabled+ is true (or unset) and no STONITH resources have been defined
* The attributes of colocation and ordering constraints were renamed for clarity.
* +resource-failure-stickiness+ has been replaced by +migration-threshold+.
* The parameters for command-line tools have been made consistent
* Switched to 'RelaxNG' schema validation and 'libxml2' parser
** id fields are now XML IDs which have the following limitations:
*** id's cannot contain colons (:)
*** id's cannot begin with a number
*** id's must be globally unique (not just unique for that tag)
** Some fields (such as those in constraints that refer to resources) are IDREFs.
+
This means that they must reference existing resources or objects in
order for the configuration to be valid.  Removing an object which is
referenced elsewhere will therefore fail.
+              
** The CIB representation, from which a MD5 digest is calculated to verify CIBs on the nodes, has changed.
+
This means that every CIB update will require a full refresh on any
upgraded nodes until the cluster is fully upgraded to 1.0.  This will
result in significant performance degradation and it is therefore
highly inadvisable to run a mixed 1.0/0.6 cluster for any longer than
absolutely necessary.
+              
* Ping node information no longer needs to be added to _ha.cf_.
+
Simply include the lists of hosts in your ping resource(s).


=== Removed ===


* Syntax
** It is no longer possible to set resource meta options as top-level
   attributes.  Use meta attributes instead.
** Resource and operation defaults are no longer read from
   +crm_config+.
