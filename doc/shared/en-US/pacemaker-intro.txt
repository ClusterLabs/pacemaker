== What Is 'Pacemaker'? ==

*Pacemaker* is a high-availability 'cluster resource manager' -- software that
runs on a set of hosts (a 'cluster' of 'nodes') in order to minimize downtime of
desired services ('resources').
footnote:[
'Cluster' is sometimes used in other contexts to refer to hosts grouped
together for other purposes, such as high-performance computing (HPC), but
Pacemaker is not intended for those purposes.
]

Pacemaker's key features include:

 * Detection of and recovery from node- and service-level failures
 * Ability to ensure data integrity by fencing faulty nodes
 * Support for one or more nodes per cluster
 * Support for multiple resource interface standards (anything that can be
   scripted can be clustered)
 * Support (but no requirement) for shared storage
 * Support for practically any redundancy configuration (active/passive, N+1,
   etc.)
 * Automatically replicated configuration that can be updated from any node
 * Ability to specify cluster-wide relationships between services,
   such as ordering, colocation and anti-colocation
 * Support for advanced service types, such as 'clones' (services that need to
   be active on multiple nodes), 'stateful resources' (clones that can run in
   one of two modes), and containerized services
 * Unified, scriptable cluster management tools

.Fencing
[NOTE]
====
'Fencing', also known as 'STONITH' (an acronym for Shoot The Other Node In The
Head), is the ability to ensure that it is not possible for a node to be
running a service. This is accomplished via 'fence devices' such as
intelligent power switches that cut power to the target, or intelligent
network switches that cut the target's access to the local network.

Pacemaker represents fence devices as a special class of resource.

A cluster cannot safely recover from certain failure conditions, such as an
unresponsive node, without fencing.

== Cluster Architecture ==

At a high level, a cluster can viewed as having these parts (which together are
often referred to as the 'cluster stack'):

 * *Resources:* These are the reason for the cluster's being -- the services
   that need to be kept highly available.

 * *Resource agents:* These are scripts or operating system components that
   start, stop, and monitor resources, given a set of resource parameters.
   These provide a uniform interface between Pacemaker and the managed
   services.

 * *Fence agents:* These are scripts that execute node fencing actions,
   given a target and fence device parameters.

 * *Cluster membership layer:* This component provides reliable
   messaging, membership, and quorum information about the cluster.
   Currently, Pacemaker supports http://www.corosync.org/[Corosync]
   as this layer.

 * *Cluster resource manager:* Pacemaker provides the brain that processes
   and reacts to events that occur in the cluster. These events may include
   nodes joining or leaving the cluster; resource events caused by failures,
   maintenance, or scheduled activities; and other administrative actions.
   To achieve the desired availability, Pacemaker may start and stop resources
   and fence nodes.

 * *Cluster tools:* These provide an interface for users to interact with the
   cluster. Various command-line and graphical (GUI) interfaces are available.

Most managed services are not, themselves, cluster-aware. However, many popular
open-source cluster filesystems make use of a common 'Distributed Lock
Manager' (DLM), which makes direct use of Corosync for its messaging and
membership capabilities and Pacemaker for the ability to fence nodes.

== Pacemaker Architecture ==

Pacemaker itself is composed of multiple daemons that work together:

 * pacemakerd
 * pacemaker-attrd
 * cib
 * crmd
 * lrmd
 * pengine
 * stonithd

.Internal Components
image::images/pcmk-internals.png["Pacemaker software components",align="center",scaledwidth="65%"]

The Pacemaker master process (pacemakerd) spawns all the other daemons, and
respawns them if they unexpectedly exit.

The 'Cluster Information Base' (CIB) is an
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML[XML] representation of the cluster's
configuration and the state of all nodes and resources. The CIB daemon (cib)
keeps the CIB synchronized across the cluster, and handles requests to modify it.

The attribute manager (pacemaker-attrd) maintains a database of attributes for
all nodes, keeps it synchronized across the cluster, and handles requests to
modify them. These attributes are usually recorded in the CIB.

Given a snapshot of the CIB as input, the 'policy engine' (pengine) determines
what actions are necessary to achieve the desired state of the cluster.

The 'local resource management daemon' (lrmd) handles requests to execute
resource agents on the local node, and returns the result.

The 'STONITH daemon' (stonithd) handles requests to fence nodes. Given a target
node, stonithd decides which cluster node(s) should execute which fencing
device(s), and calls the necessary fencing agents (either directly, or via
requests to stonithd peers on other nodes), and returns the result.

The 'cluster resource management daemon' ('CRMd') is Pacemaker's coordinator,
maintaining a consistent view of the cluster membership and orchestrating all
the other components.

Pacemaker centralizes cluster decision-making by electing one of the CRMd
instances as the 'Designated Controller' ('DC'). Should the elected CRMd
process (or the node it is on) fail, a new one is quickly established.
The DC responds to cluster events by taking a current snapshot of the CIB,
feeding it to the policy engine, then asking the lrmd (either directly on the
local node, or via requests to crmd peers on other nodes) and stonithd to
execute any necessary actions.

.Old daemon names
[NOTE]
====
The Pacemaker daemons were renamed in version 2.0. You may still find
references to the old names, especially in documentation targeted to version
1.1.

== Node Redundancy Designs ==

Pacemaker supports practically any
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-availability_cluster#Node_configurations[node
redundancy configuration] including 'Active/Active', 'Active/Passive', 'N+1',
'N+M', 'N-to-1' and 'N-to-N'.

Active/passive clusters with two (or more) nodes using Pacemaker and
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_Replicated_Block_Device:[DRBD] are
a cost-effective high-availability solution for many situations. One of the
nodes provides the desired services, and if it fails, the other node takes
over.

.Active/Passive Redundancy

Pacemaker also supports multiple nodes in a shared-failover design,
reducing hardware costs by allowing several active/passive clusters to be
combined and share a common backup node.

.Shared Failover
image::images/pcmk-shared-failover.png["Shared Failover",width="10cm",height="7.5cm",align="center"]

When shared storage is available, every node can potentially be used for
failover. Pacemaker can even run multiple copies of services to spread out the
workload.
