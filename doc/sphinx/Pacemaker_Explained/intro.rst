The Scope of this Document
##########################

This document is intended to be an exhaustive reference for configuring
Pacemaker. To achieve this, it focuses on the XML syntax used to configure the
CIB.

For those that are allergic to XML, multiple higher-level front-ends
(both command-line and GUI) are available. These tools will not be covered
in this document, though the concepts explained here should make the
functionality of these tools more easily understood.
      
Users may be interested in other parts of the
`Pacemaker documentation set <https://www.clusterlabs.org/pacemaker/doc/>`_,
such as *Clusters from Scratch*, a step-by-step guide to setting up an
example cluster, and *Pacemaker Administration*, a guide to maintaining a
cluster.
