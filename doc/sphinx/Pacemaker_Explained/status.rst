Status
------
Pacemaker automatically generates a ``status`` section in the CIB (inside the
``cib`` element, at the same level as ``configuration``). The status is
transient, and is not stored to disk with the rest of the CIB.

The section's structure and contents are internal to Pacemaker and subject to
change from release to release. Its often obscure element and attribute names
are kept for historical reasons, to maintain compatibility with older versions
during rolling upgrades.

Users should not modify the section directly, though various command-line tool
options affect it indirectly.

Node State
##########
   
The ``status`` element contains ``node_state`` elements for each node in the
cluster (and potentially nodes that have been removed from the configuration
since the cluster started). The ``node_state`` element has attributes that
allow the cluster to determine whether the node is healthy.

Transient Node Attributes
#########################
   
The ``transient_attributes`` section specifies transient
:ref:`node_attributes`. In addition to any values set by the administrator or
resource agents using the ``attrd_updater`` or ``crm_attribute`` tools, the
cluster stores various state information here.

Node History
############

Each ``node_state`` element contains an ``lrm`` element with a history of
certain resource actions performed on the node. The ``lrm`` element contains an
``lrm_resources`` element.

.. index::
   pair: XML element; lrm_resource
   pair: resource; history

Resource History
________________

The ``lrm_resources`` element contains an ``lrm_resource`` element for each
resource that has had an action performed on the node.

An ``lrm_resource`` entry has attributes allowing the cluster to stop the
resource safely even if it is removed from the configuration. Specifically, the
resource's ``id``, ``class``, ``type`` and ``provider`` are recorded.

.. index::
   pair: XML element; lrm_rsc_op
   pair: action; history

Action History
______________

Each ``lrm_resource`` element contains an ``lrm_rsc_op`` element for each
recorded action performed for that resource on that node. (Not all actions are
recorded, just enough to determine the resource's state.)

Simple Operation History Example
________________________________

.. topic:: A monitor operation (determines current state of the ``apcstonith`` resource)

   .. code-block:: xml

      <lrm_resource id="apcstonith" type="fence_apc_snmp" class="stonith">
        <lrm_rsc_op id="apcstonith_monitor_0" operation="monitor" call-id="2"
          rc-code="7" op-status="0" interval="0"
          crm-debug-origin="do_update_resource" crm_feature_set="3.0.1"
          op-digest="2e3da9274d3550dc6526fb24bfcbcba0"
          transition-key="22:2:7:2668bbeb-06d5-40f9-936d-24cb7f87006a"
          transition-magic="0:7;22:2:7:2668bbeb-06d5-40f9-936d-24cb7f87006a"
          last-rc-change="1239008085" exec-time="10" queue-time="0"/>
      </lrm_resource>

The above example shows the history entry for a probe (non-recurring monitor
operation) for the ``apcstonith`` resource.

The cluster schedules probes for every configured resource on a node when
the node first starts, in order to determine the resource's current state
before it takes any further action.

From the ``transition-key``, we can see that this was the 22nd action of
the 2nd graph produced by this instance of the controller
(2668bbeb-06d5-40f9-936d-24cb7f87006a).

The third field of the ``transition-key`` contains a 7, which indicates
that the cluster expects to find the resource inactive. By looking at the
``rc-code`` property, we see that this was the case.

As that is the only action recorded for this node, we can conclude that
the cluster started the resource elsewhere.

Complex Operation History Example

.. topic:: Resource history of a ``pingd`` clone with multiple entries

   .. code-block:: xml

      <lrm_resource id="pingd:0" type="pingd" class="ocf" provider="pacemaker">
        <lrm_rsc_op id="pingd:0_monitor_30000" operation="monitor" call-id="34"
          rc-code="0" op-status="0" interval="30000"
          crm-debug-origin="do_update_resource" crm_feature_set="3.0.1"
          transition-key="10:11:0:2668bbeb-06d5-40f9-936d-24cb7f87006a"
          last-rc-change="1239009741" exec-time="10" queue-time="0"/>
        <lrm_rsc_op id="pingd:0_stop_0" operation="stop"
          crm-debug-origin="do_update_resource" crm_feature_set="3.0.1" call-id="32"
          rc-code="0" op-status="0" interval="0"
          transition-key="11:11:0:2668bbeb-06d5-40f9-936d-24cb7f87006a"
          last-rc-change="1239009741" exec-time="10" queue-time="0"/>
        <lrm_rsc_op id="pingd:0_start_0" operation="start" call-id="33"
          rc-code="0" op-status="0" interval="0"
          crm-debug-origin="do_update_resource" crm_feature_set="3.0.1"
          transition-key="31:11:0:2668bbeb-06d5-40f9-936d-24cb7f87006a"
          last-rc-change="1239009741" exec-time="10" queue-time="0" />
        <lrm_rsc_op id="pingd:0_monitor_0" operation="monitor" call-id="3"
          rc-code="0" op-status="0" interval="0"
          crm-debug-origin="do_update_resource" crm_feature_set="3.0.1"
          transition-key="23:2:7:2668bbeb-06d5-40f9-936d-24cb7f87006a"
          last-rc-change="1239008085" exec-time="20" queue-time="0"/>
        </lrm_resource>

When more than one history entry exists, it is important to first sort
them by ``call-id`` before interpreting them.

Once sorted, the above example can be summarized as:

#. A non-recurring monitor operation returning 7 (not running), with a
   ``call-id`` of 3
#. A stop operation returning 0 (success), with a ``call-id`` of 32
#. A start operation returning 0 (success), with a ``call-id`` of 33
#. A recurring monitor returning 0 (success), with a ``call-id`` of 34

The cluster processes each history entry to build up a picture of the
resource's state.  After the first and second entries, it is
considered stopped, and after the third it considered active.

Based on the last operation, we can tell that the resource is
currently active.

Additionally, from the presence of a ``stop`` operation with a lower
``call-id`` than that of the ``start`` operation, we can conclude that the
resource has been restarted.  Specifically this occurred as part of
actions 11 and 31 of transition 11 from the controller instance with the key
``2668bbeb...``.  This information can be helpful for locating the
relevant section of the logs when looking for the source of a failure.
