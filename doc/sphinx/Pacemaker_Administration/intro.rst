The Scope of this Document
##########################

The purpose of this document is to help system administrators learn how to
manage a Pacemaker cluster.

System administrators may be interested in other parts of the
`Pacemaker documentation set <https://www.clusterlabs.org/pacemaker/doc/>`_
such as *Clusters from Scratch*, a step-by-step guide to setting up an example
cluster, and *Pacemaker Explained*, an exhaustive reference for cluster
configuration.

Multiple higher-level tools (both command-line and GUI) are available to
simplify cluster management. However, this document focuses on the lower-level
command-line tools that come with Pacemaker itself. The concepts are applicable
to the higher-level tools, though the syntax would differ.
