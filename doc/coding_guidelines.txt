== Introduction ==

The purpose of this document is to discuss guidelines about how to write
code that will be a part of the Pacemaker project.

== Formatting Guidelines ==

=== Whitespace ===

- Indentation must be 4 spaces, no tabs.
- Do not leave trailing whitespace.

=== Line Length ===

- Lines should be no longer than 80 characters unless limiting line length significantly impacts readability.

=== Pointers ===

- The '*' goes by the variable name, not the type:

```
    char *foo;
```

- Use a space before the '*' and after the closing parenthesis in a cast:

```
    char *foo = (char *) bar;
```

=== Functions ===

- Put the return type on its own line:
- Place the opening brace for a function on the next line:

```
    static int
    foo(void)
    {
```

- For functions with enough arguments that they must break to the next line, align arguments with the first argument:

```
    static int
    function_name(int bar, const char *a, const char *b,
                  const char *c, const char *d)
    {
```

- If a function name gets really long, start the arguments on their own line with 8 spaces of indentation:

```
    static int
    really_really_long_function_name_this_is_getting_silly_now(
            int bar, const char *a, const char *b,
            const char *c, const char *d)
    {
```

=== Control statements (if, else, while, for, switch) ===

- Keyword is followed by one space, then left parenthesis witout space,
  condition, right parenthesis, space, opening bracket on the same line.

- "else" and "else if" are on the same line with ending brace and opening
  brace, separated by space

```
    if (condition1) {
        statement1;
    } else if (condition2) {
        statement2;
    } else {
        statement3;
    }
```

- Cases in switch statement have same indentation as switch. Body of cases
  is indented by one level. Opening brace is on the same line as switch.

```
    switch (expression)
    {
        case 0:
            command0;
            break;
        case 1:
            command1;
            break;
        default:
            command;
    }
```

=== Operators ===

- Operators have spaces from both sides. Do not rely on operator precedence,
  use brackets when mixing operators with different priority.
- No space after opening bracked and before closing bracket.

```
    x = a + b - (c * d);
```

== Naming Conventions ==

- Public C API calls and type names must begin with an API specific prefix, eg. "crm_", "pe_", "st_", "lrm_".

== vim Settings ==

```vim
    " This section contains settings that can be placed in the vimrc file that are
    " compatible with the Pacemaker coding guidelines.

    " Whitespace
    set ts=4
    set sw=4
    set expandtab
    let c_space_error=1
```
