=== Node List ===

The list of cluster nodes is automatically populated by the cluster.

.....
node pcmk-1
node pcmk-2
.....


=== Cluster Options ===

This is where the cluster automatically stores some information about
the cluster

* dc-version - the version (including upstream source-code hash) of Pacemaker used on the DC

* cluster-infrastructure - the cluster infrastructure being used (heartbeat or openais)

* expected-quorum-votes - the maximum number of nodes expected to be part of the cluster

and where the admin can set options that control the way the cluster
operates

* stonith-enabled=true - Make use of STONITH

* no-quorum-policy=ignore - Ignore loss of quorum and continue to host resources.

.....

    expected-quorum-votes="2" \
    stonith-enabled="true" \
    no-quorum-policy="ignore"
.....


=== Resources ===


==== Default Options ====

Here we configure cluster options that apply to every resource.

* resource-stickiness - Specify the aversion to moving resources to other machines

.....
rsc_defaults $id="rsc-options" \
    resource-stickiness="100"

==== Fencing ====


[NOTE]
=======
TODO: Add text here
=======

.....
primitive ipmi-fencing stonith::fence_ipmilan \
    params pcmk_host_list="pcmk-1 pcmk-2" ipaddr=10.0.0.1 login=testuser passwd=abc123 \
    op monitor interval="60s"
clone Fencing rsa-fencing
.....

==== Service Address ====

Users of the services provided by the cluster require an unchanging
address with which to access it. Additionally, we cloned the address so
it will be active on both nodes. An iptables rule (created as part of the
resource agent) is used to ensure that each request only gets processed by one
of the two clone instances. The additional meta options tell the cluster
that we want two instances of the clone (one "request bucket" for each
node) and that if one node fails, then the remaining node should hold
both.

.....
primitive ClusterIP ocf:heartbeat:IPaddr2 \
    params ip="192.168.122.101" cidr_netmask="32" clusterip_hash="sourceip" \
    op monitor interval="30s"
clone WebIP ClusterIP
    meta globally-unique="true" clone-max="2" clone-node-max="2"
.....


[NOTE]
=======
TODO: The RA should check for globally-unique=true when cloned
=======

==== DRBD - Shared Storage ====

Here we define the DRBD service and specify which DRBD resource (from
drbd.conf) it should manage. We make it a master/slave resource and, in
order to have an active/active setup, allow both instances to be promoted
by specifying master-max=2. We also set the notify option so that the
cluster will tell DRBD agent when it's peer changes state.

.....
primitive WebData ocf:linbit:drbd \
    params drbd_resource="wwwdata" \
    op monitor interval="60s"
ms WebDataClone WebData \
    meta master-max="2" master-node-max="1" clone-max="2" clone-node-max="1" notify="true"
.....


==== Cluster Filesystem ====

The cluster filesystem ensures that files are read and written correctly.
We need to specify the block device (provided by DRBD), where we want it
mounted and that we are using GFS2. Again it is a clone because it is
intended to be active on both nodes. The additional constraints ensure
that it can only be started on nodes with active gfs-control and drbd
instances.

.....
primitive WebFS ocf:heartbeat:Filesystem \
    params device="/dev/drbd/by-res/wwwdata" directory="/var/www/html" fstype="gfs2"
clone WebFSClone WebFS
colocation WebFS-with-gfs-control inf: WebFSClone gfs-clone
colocation fs_on_drbd inf: WebFSClone WebDataClone:Master
order WebFS-after-WebData inf: WebDataClone:promote WebFSClone:start
order start-WebFS-after-gfs-control inf: gfs-clone WebFSClone
.....

==== Apache ====

Lastly we have the actual service, Apache. We need only tell the cluster
where to find it's main configuration file and restrict it to running on
nodes that have the required filesystem mounted and the IP address
active.

.....
primitive WebSite ocf:heartbeat:apache \
    params configfile="/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf" \
    op monitor interval="1min"
