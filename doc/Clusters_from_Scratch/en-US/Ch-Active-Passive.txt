= Creating an Active/Passive Cluster =

== Exploring the Existing Configuration ==

When Pacemaker starts up, it automatically records the number and details
of the nodes in the cluster as well as which stack is being used and the
version of Pacemaker being used.

This is what the base configuration should look like.

Before we make any changes, its a good idea to check the validity of
the configuration.

[source,Bash]
----

   error: unpack_resources: Resource start-up disabled since no STONITH resources have been defined
   error: unpack_resources: Either configure some or disable STONITH with the stonith-enabled option
   error: unpack_resources: NOTE: Clusters with shared data need STONITH to ensure data integrity
Errors found during check: config not valid
  -V may provide more details
----

As you can see, the tool has found some errors.

In order to guarantee the safety of your data
footnote:[If the data is corrupt, there is little point in continuing to make it available]
, Pacemaker ships with STONITH
footnote:[A common node fencing mechanism. Used to ensure data integrity by powering off "bad" nodes]
enabled.  However it also knows when no STONITH configuration has been
supplied and reports this as a problem (since the cluster would not be
able to make progress if a situation requiring node fencing arose).

For now, we will disable this feature and configure it later in the
Configuring STONITH section. It is important to note that the use of
STONITH is highly encouraged, turning it off tells the cluster to
simply pretend that failed nodes are safely powered off. Some vendors
will even refuse to support clusters that have it disabled.

To disable STONITH, we set the stonith-enabled cluster option to
false.

ifdef::pcs[]
[source,Bash]
----
# pcs property set stonith-enabled=false
# crm_verify -L
----
endif::[]

ifdef::crm[]
[source,Bash]
----
# crm configure property stonith-enabled=false
# crm_verify -L
----
endif::[]

With the new cluster option set, the configuration is now valid.

[WARNING]
=========

The use of stonith-enabled=false is completely inappropriate for a
production cluster. We use it here to defer the discussion of its
configuration which can differ widely from one installation to the
next.  See  <<_what_is_stonith>> for information on why STONITH is important
and details on how to configure it.

=========

== Adding a Resource ==

The first thing we should do is configure an IP address. Regardless of
where the cluster service(s) are running, we need a consistent address
to contact them on. Here I will choose and add 192.168.122.120 as the
floating address, give it the imaginative name ClusterIP and tell the
cluster to check that its running every 30 seconds.


[IMPORTANT]
===========
The chosen address must not be one already associated with
a physical node
===========

[source,Bash]

----
endif::[]

The other important piece of information here is ocf:heartbeat:IPaddr2.

This tells Pacemaker three things about the resource you want to
add. The first field, ocf, is the standard to which the resource
script conforms to and where to find it. The second field is specific
to OCF resources and tells the cluster which namespace to find the
resource script in, in this case heartbeat. The last field indicates
the name of the resource script.

There are three things to notice about the cluster's current
state. The first is that, as expected, +pcmk-1+ is now offline. However
we can also see that +ClusterIP+ isn't running anywhere!


=== Quorum and Two-Node Clusters ===

This is because the cluster no longer has quorum, as can be seen by
the text "partition WITHOUT quorum" in the status output.  In order
to reduce the possibility of data corruption, Pacemaker's default
behavior is to stop all resources if the cluster does not have quorum.

A cluster is said to have quorum when more than half the known or
expected nodes are online, or for the mathematically inclined,
whenever the following equation is true:

....
total_nodes < 2 * active_nodes
....

Therefore a two-node cluster only has quorum when both nodes are
running, which is no longer the case for our cluster. This would
normally make the creation of a two-node cluster pointless
footnote:[Actually some would argue that two-node clusters are always pointless, but that is an argument for another time]
, however it is possible to control how Pacemaker behaves when quorum
is lost. In particular, we can tell the cluster to simply ignore
quorum altogether.

After a few moments, the cluster will start the IP address on the
remaining node. Note that the cluster still does not have quorum.

======
In the dark days, the cluster may have moved the IP back to its
original location (+pcmk-1+).  Usually this is no longer the case.

=== Prevent Resources from Moving after Recovery ===

In most circumstances, it is highly desirable to prevent healthy
resources from being moved around the cluster. Moving resources almost
always requires a period of downtime. For complex services like Oracle
databases, this period can be quite long.

To address this, Pacemaker has the concept of resource stickiness
which controls how much a service prefers to stay running where it
is. You may like to think of it as the "cost" of any downtime. By
default, Pacemaker assumes there is zero cost associated with moving
resources and will do so to achieve "optimal"
footnote:[It should be noted that Pacemaker's definition of
optimal may not always agree with that of a human's. The order in which
Pacemaker processes lists of resources and nodes creates implicit
preferences in situations where the administrator has not explicitly
specified them]
resource placement. We can specify a different stickiness for every
resource, but it is often sufficient to change the default.
