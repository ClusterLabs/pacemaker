= Start and Verify Cluster =

== Start the Cluster ==

Now that corosync is configured, it is time to start the cluster.
The command below will start corosync and pacemaker on both nodes
in the cluster.  If you are issuing the start command from a different
node than the one you ran the `pcs cluster auth` command on earlier, you
must authenticate on the current node you are logged into before you will
be allowed to start the cluster.

----
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# pcs cluster start --all
pcmk-1: Starting Cluster...
pcmk-2: Starting Cluster...
----

[NOTE]
======
An alternative to using the `pcs cluster start --all` command
is to issue either of the below command sequences on each node in the
cluster separately:

----
# pcs cluster start
Starting Cluster...
----

or

----
# systemctl start corosync.service
# systemctl start pacemaker.service
----
======

[IMPORTANT]
====
In this example, we are not enabling the corosync and pacemaker services
to start at boot. If a cluster node fails or is rebooted, you will need to run
+pcs cluster start pass:[<replaceable>nodename</replaceable>]+ (or `--all`) to start the cluster on it.
While you could enable the services to start at boot, requiring a manual
start of cluster services gives you the opportunity to do a post-mortem investigation
of a node failure before returning it to the cluster.
====

== Verify Corosync Installation ==

First, use `corosync-cfgtool` to check whether cluster communication is happy:

----
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# corosync-cfgtool -s
Printing ring status.
Local node ID 1
RING ID 0
	id	= 192.168.122.101
	status	= ring 0 active with no faults
----

We can see here that everything appears normal with our fixed IP
address (not a 127.0.0.x loopback address) listed as the *id*, and *no
faults* for the status.

If you see something different, you might want to start by checking
the node's network, firewall and selinux configurations.

Next, check the membership and quorum APIs:

----
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# corosync-cmapctl  | grep members 
runtime.totem.pg.mrp.srp.members.1.ip (str) = r(0) ip(192.168.122.101) 
runtime.totem.pg.mrp.srp.members.1.join_count (u32) = 1
runtime.totem.pg.mrp.srp.members.1.status (str) = joined
runtime.totem.pg.mrp.srp.members.2.ip (str) = r(0) ip(192.168.122.102) 
runtime.totem.pg.mrp.srp.members.2.join_count (u32) = 1
runtime.totem.pg.mrp.srp.members.2.status (str) = joined

[root@pcmk-1 ~]# pcs status corosync 
Membership information
 --------------------------
    Nodeid      Votes Name
         1          1 pcmk-1 (local)
         2          1 pcmk-2
----

You should see both nodes have joined the cluster.

== Verify Pacemaker Installation ==

Now that we have confirmed that Corosync is functional, we can check
the rest of the stack. Pacemaker has already been started, so verify
the necessary processes are running:

----
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# ps axf
  PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
    2 ?        S      0:00 [kthreadd]
...lots of processes...
28019 ?        Ssl    0:03 /usr/sbin/corosync
28047 ?        Ss     0:00 /usr/sbin/pacemakerd -f
28048 ?        Ss     0:00  \_ /usr/libexec/pacemaker/cib
28049 ?        Ss     0:00  \_ /usr/libexec/pacemaker/stonithd
28050 ?        Ss     0:00  \_ /usr/lib64/heartbeat/lrmd
28051 ?        Ss     0:00  \_ /usr/libexec/pacemaker/attrd
28052 ?        Ss     0:00  \_ /usr/libexec/pacemaker/pengine
28053 ?        Ss     0:00  \_ /usr/libexec/pacemaker/crmd
----

If that looks OK, check the `pcs status` output:

----
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# pcs status
Cluster name: mycluster
WARNING: no stonith devices and stonith-enabled is not false
Last updated: Tue Dec 16 16:15:29 2014
Last change: Tue Dec 16 15:49:47 2014
Stack: corosync
Current DC: pcmk-2 (2) - partition with quorum
Version: 1.1.12-a9c8177
2 Nodes configured
0 Resources configured


Online: [ pcmk-1 pcmk-2 ]

Full list of resources:


PCSD Status:
  pcmk-1: Online
  pcmk-2: Online

Daemon Status:
  corosync: active/disabled
  pacemaker: active/disabled
  pcsd: active/enabled
----

Finally, ensure there are no startup errors (aside from messages relating
to not having STONITH configured, which are OK at this point):
----
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# journalctl | grep -i error
----

[NOTE]
======
Other operating systems will report startup errors in other locations.
For example, on Fedora 19 and earlier, the command would be:
----
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# grep -i error /var/log/messages
----
======

Repeat these checks on the other node. The results should be the same.
