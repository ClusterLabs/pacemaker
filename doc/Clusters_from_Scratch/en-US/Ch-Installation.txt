== OS Installation ==

Detailed instructions for installing Fedora are available at
http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/17/html/Installation_Guide/ in a number of
languages. The abbreviated version is as follows...

Point your browser to http://fedoraproject.org/en/get-fedora-all,
locate the +Install Media+ section and download the install DVD that
matches your hardware.

Burn the disk image to a DVD
footnote:[http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/16/html/Burning_ISO_images_to_disc/index.html]
and boot from it, or use the image to boot a virtual machine.

After clicking through the welcome screen, select your language,
keyboard layout
footnote:[http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/16/html/Installation_Guide/sn-keyboard-x86.html]
and storage type
footnote:[http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/16/html/Installation_Guide/Storage_Devices-x86.html]

Assign your machine a host name.
footnote:[http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/16/html/Installation_Guide/sn-Netconfig-x86.html]
I happen to control the clusterlabs.org domain name, so I will use
that here.

[IMPORTANT]
===========
Do not accept the default network settings.
Cluster machines should never obtain an IP address via DHCP.

When you are presented with the +Configure Network+ advanced option, select that option
before continuing with the installation process to specify a fixed IPv4 address for
+System eth0+. Be sure to also enter the +Routes+ section and add an entry for your
default gateway.

image::images/Network.png["Custom network settings",align="center"]

If you miss this step, this can easily be configured after installation. You will have
to navigate to +system settings+ and select +network+.  From there you can select
what device to configure.
===========

You will then be prompted to indicate the machine's physical location
footnote:[http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/16/html/Installation_Guide/s1-timezone-x86.html]
and to supply a root password.
footnote:[http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/16/html/Installation_Guide/sn-account_configuration-x86.html]

Now select where you want Fedora installed.
footnote:[http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/16/html/Installation_Guide/s1-diskpartsetup-x86.html]
As I don’t care about any existing data, I will accept the default and
allow Fedora to use the complete drive.

[IMPORTANT]
===========

By default Fedora uses LVM for partitioning which allows us to
dynamically change the amount of space allocated to a given partition.

However, by default it also allocates all free space to the +/+
(aka. +root+) partition which cannot be dynamically _reduced_ in size
(dynamic increases are fine by-the-way).

So if you plan on following the DRBD or GFS2 portions of this guide,
you should reserve at least 1Gb of space on each machine from which to
create a shared volume.  To do so select the +Review and modify
partitioning layout+ checkbox before clicking +Next+.  You will then
be given an opportunity to reduce the size of the +root+ partition.

===========

Next choose which software should be
installed. footnote:[http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/16/html/Installation_Guide/s1-pkgselection-x86.html]
Change the selection to Minimal so that we see everything that gets
installed. Don't enable updates yet, we'll do that (and install any
extra software we need) later. After you click next, Fedora will begin
installing.

Go grab something to drink, this may take a while.

Once the node reboots, you'll see a (possibly mangled) login prompt on
the console.  Login using +root+ and the password you created earlier.

[NOTE]
======

From here on in we're going to be working exclusively from the terminal.

======

== Post Installation Tasks ==

=== Networking ===

Bring up the network and ensure it starts at boot

[source,Bash]
....
# service network start
# chkconfig network on
....

Check the machine has the static IP address you configured earlier

[source,Bash]
....
# ip addr
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 16436 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
    inet6 ::1/128 scope host
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP qlen 1000
    link/ether 52:54:00:d7:d6:08 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 192.168.122.101/24 brd 192.168.122.255 scope global eth0
    inet6 fe80::5054:ff:fed7:d608/64 scope link
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
....

Now check the default route setting:

[source,Bash]
....
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# ip route
default via 192.168.122.1 dev eth0
192.168.122.0/24 dev eth0  proto kernel  scope link  src 192.168.122.101
....

If there is no line beginning with +default via+, then you may need to add a line such as

  GATEWAY=192.168.122.1

to '/etc/sysconfig/network' and restart the network.

Now check for connectivity to the outside world.  Start small by
testing if we can read the gateway we configured.

[source,Bash]
....
# ping -c 1 192.168.122.1
PING 192.168.122.1 (192.168.122.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 192.168.122.1: icmp_req=1 ttl=64 time=0.249 ms

--- 192.168.122.1 ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.249/0.249/0.249/0.000 ms
....

Now try something external, choose a location you know will be available.

[source,Bash]
....
# ping -c 1 www.google.com
PING www.l.google.com (173.194.72.106) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from tf-in-f106.1e100.net (173.194.72.106): icmp_req=1 ttl=41 time=167 ms

--- www.l.google.com ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 167.618/167.618/167.618/0.000 ms
....

=== Leaving the Console ===

The console isn't a very friendly place to work from, we will now
switch to accessing the machine remotely via SSH where we can
use copy&paste etc.

First we check we can see the newly installed at all:

[source,Bash]
....
beekhof@f16 ~ # ping -c 1 192.168.122.101
PING 192.168.122.101 (192.168.122.101) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 192.168.122.101: icmp_req=1 ttl=64 time=1.01 ms

--- 192.168.122.101 ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 1.012/1.012/1.012/0.000 ms
....

Next we login via SSH

[source,Bash]
....
beekhof@f16 ~ # ssh -l root 192.168.122.11
root@192.168.122.11's password:
Last login: Fri Mar 30 19:41:19 2012 from 192.168.122.1
[root@pcmk-1 ~]#
....

=== Security Shortcuts ===

To simplify this guide and focus on the aspects directly connected to
clustering, we will now disable the machine's firewall and SELinux
installation.

[WARNING]
===========
Both of these actions create significant security issues
and should not be performed on machines that will be exposed to the
outside world.
===========

[IMPORTANT]
===========
 TODO: Create an Appendix that deals with (at least) re-enabling the firewall.
===========

[source,Bash]
----
# setenforce 0
# sed -i.bak "s/SELINUX=enforcing/SELINUX=permissive/g" /etc/selinux/config
# systemctl disable iptables.service
rm '/etc/systemd/system/basic.target.wants/iptables.service'
# systemctl stop iptables.service
----

=== Short Node Names ===

During installation, we filled in the machine's fully qualifier domain
name (FQDN) which can be rather long when it appears in cluster logs and
status output. See for yourself how the machine identifies itself:
(((Nodes, short name)))

[source,Bash]
----
# uname -n
pcmk-1.clusterlabs.org
# dnsdomainname
clusterlabs.org
----
(((Nodes, Domain name (Query))))

The output from the second command is fine, but we really don't need the
domain name included in the basic host details. To address this, we need
to update /etc/sysconfig/network. This is what it should look like before
we start.

[source,Bash]
----
# cat /etc/sysconfig/network
NETWORKING=yes
HOSTNAME=pcmk-1.clusterlabs.org
GATEWAY=192.168.122.1
----

All we need to do now is strip off the domain name portion, which is
stored elsewhere anyway.

[source,Bash]
----
 # sed -i.sed 's/\.[a-z].*//g' /etc/sysconfig/network
----

Now confirm the change was successful. The revised file contents should
look something like this.

[source,Bash]
----
# cat /etc/sysconfig/network
NETWORKING=yes
HOSTNAME=pcmk-1
GATEWAY=192.168.122.1
----

However we're not finished. The machine wont normally see the shortened
host name until about it reboots, but we can force it to update.

[source,Bash]
----
# source /etc/sysconfig/network
# hostname $HOSTNAME
----
(((Nodes, Domain name (Remove from host name))))

Now check the machine is using the correct names

[source,Bash]
----
# uname -n
pcmk-1
# dnsdomainname
clusterlabs.org
----

=== NTP ===

It is highly recommended to enable NTP on your cluster nodes. Doing so
ensures all nodes agree on the current time and makes reading log files
significantly easier. footnote:[http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/17/html-single/System_Administrators_Guide/index.html#ch-Configuring_the_Date_and_Time]

== Before You Continue ==

Repeat the Installation steps so far, so that you have two Fedora
nodes ready to have the cluster software installed.

For the purposes of this document, the additional node is called
pcmk-2 with address 192.168.122.102.

=== Finalize Networking ===

Confirm that you can communicate between the two new nodes:

[source,Bash]
----
# ping -c 3 192.168.122.102
PING 192.168.122.102 (192.168.122.102) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 192.168.122.102: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.343 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.122.102: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.402 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.122.102: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.558 ms

--- 192.168.122.102 ping statistics ---
3 packets transmitted, 3 received, 0% packet loss, time 2000ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.343/0.434/0.558/0.092 ms
----

Now we need to make sure we can communicate with the machines by their
name. If you have a DNS server, add additional entries for the two
machines. Otherwise, you'll need to add the machines to '/etc/hosts' .
Below are the entries for my cluster nodes:

[source,Bash]
----
# grep pcmk /etc/hosts
192.168.122.101 pcmk-1.clusterlabs.org pcmk-1
192.168.122.102 pcmk-2.clusterlabs.org pcmk-2
----

We can now verify the setup by again using ping:

[source,Bash]
----
# ping -c 3 pcmk-2
PING pcmk-2.clusterlabs.org (192.168.122.101) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from pcmk-1.clusterlabs.org (192.168.122.101): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.164 ms
64 bytes from pcmk-1.clusterlabs.org (192.168.122.101): icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.475 ms
64 bytes from pcmk-1.clusterlabs.org (192.168.122.101): icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.186 ms

--- pcmk-2.clusterlabs.org ping statistics ---
3 packets transmitted, 3 received, 0% packet loss, time 2001ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.164/0.275/0.475/0.141 ms
----

=== Configure SSH ===

SSH is a convenient and secure way to copy files and perform commands
remotely. For the purposes of this guide, we will create a key without a
password (using the -N option) so that we can perform remote actions
without being prompted.

(((SSH)))

[WARNING]
=========
Unprotected SSH keys, those without a password, are not recommended for servers exposed to the outside world.
We use them here only to simplify the demo.
=========

Create a new key and allow anyone with that key to log in:

Complete!
[root@pcmk-1 ~]#
----

Now install the cluster software on the second node.

ifdef::pcs[]
=== Install the Cluster Management Software ===
The pcs cli command coupled with the pcs daemon creates a cluster
management system capable of managing all aspects of the cluster stack
across all nodes from a single location.

[source,Bash]
----
# yum install -y pcs
----

Make sure to install the pcs packages on both nodes.
endif::[]

== Setup ==

ifdef::pcs[]
=== Enable pcs Daemon ===

Before the cluster can be configured, the pcs daemon must be started and enabled
to boot on startup on each node.  This daemon works with the pcs cli command to manage
syncing the corosync configuration across all the nodes in the cluster.

Start and enable the daemon by issuing the following commands on each node.

[source,Bash]
----
# systemctl start pcsd.service
# systemctl enable pcsd.service
----

Now setup a common pcs user account on each node in the cluster using
the pcs_passwd command. In the example below, the user account 'pcmk'
is created.  You will be asked to supply a password (or supply one
with the -p option).  Make sure the username and password is
consistent across all the nodes.

[source,Bash]
----
# pcs_passwd pcmk
password:
----

The pcs daemon account is required on each node to enable remote pcs command
authentication.  While the pcs cli command can be used locally without setting
up a pcs daemon user account, access to pcs features that require access to remote
nodes (such as syncing the corosync config, or starting/stopping the cluster on remote
nodes) will be unavailable.  This tutorial will make use of these remote access commands.

endif::[]

=== Configuring Corosync ===

ifdef::pcs[]
In the past, at this point in the tutorial an explanation of how to configure and
propagate corosync's /etc/corosync.conf file would be necessary. Using pcs with the
pcs daemon greatly simplifies this process by generating the corosync.conf
across all the nodes in the cluster with a single command.  The only thing required
to achieve this is to authenticate as the pcs user 'pcmk' on one of the nodes in the
cluster, and then issue the 'pcs cluster setup' command with a list of all the
node names in the cluster.

[source,Bash]
----
# pcs cluster auth pcmk-1 pcmk-2
Username: pcmk
Password: 
pcmk-1: Authorized
pcmk-2: Authorized

# pcs cluster setup mycluster pcmk-1 pcmk-2
pcmk-1: Succeeded
pcmk-2: Succeeded
----

That's it.  Corosync is configured across the cluster.  If you received an
authorization error for either of those commands, make sure you setup the
'pcmk' user account using the pcs_passwd command on every node in the cluster
with the same password.

Choose a port number and multi-cast footnote:[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast] address. footnote:[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_address]
Be sure that the values you chose do not conflict with any existing clusters you might have.
For advice on choosing a multi-cast address, see
http://www.29west.com/docs/THPM/multicast-address-assignment.html
For this document, I have chosen port 4000 and used 239.255.1.1 as the multi-cast address.


[IMPORTANT]
===========
The instructions below only apply for a machine with a single NIC. If you
have a more complicated setup, you should edit the configuration
manually.
===========

[source,Bash]
----
# export ais_port=4000
# export ais_mcast=239.255.1.1
----

Next we automatically determine the hosts address. By not using the full
address, we make the configuration suitable to be copied to other nodes.

[source,Bash]
----
# export ais_addr=`ip addr | grep "inet " | tail -n 1 | awk '{print $4}' | sed s/255/0/`
----

Display and verify the configuration options

[source,Bash]
----
# env | grep ais_
ais_mcast=239.255.1.1
ais_port=4000
ais_addr=192.168.122.0
----

Once you're happy with the chosen values, update the Corosync
configuration

[source,Bash]
----
# cp /etc/corosync/corosync.conf.example /etc/corosync/corosync.conf
# sed -i.bak "s/.*mcastaddr:.*/mcastaddr:\ $ais_mcast/g" /etc/corosync/corosync.conf
# sed -i.bak "s/.*mcastport:.*/mcastport:\ $ais_port/g" /etc/corosync/corosync.conf
# sed -i.bak "s/.*\tbindnetaddr:.*/bindnetaddr:\ $ais_addr/g" /etc/corosync/corosync.conf
----

Lastly, you'll need to enable quorum

[source,Bash]
....
cat << END >> /etc/corosync/corosync.conf
quorum {
           provider: corosync_votequorum
           expected_votes: 2
}
END
....

endif::[]

The final /etc/corosync.conf configuration on each node should look
something like the sample in Appendix B, Sample Corosync Configuration.


[IMPORTANT]
===========
Pacemaker used to obtain membership and quorum from a custom Corosync plugin.
This plugin also had the capability to start Pacemaker automatically when Corosync was started.

Neither behavior is possible with Corosync 2.0 and beyond as support for plugins was removed.

Instead, Pacemaker must started as a separate job/initscript.
Also, since Pacemaker made use of the plugin for message routing, a node using the plugin (Corosync prior to 2.0) cannot talk to one that isn't (Corosync 2.0+).

Rolling upgrades between these versions are therefor not possible and an alternate strategy footnote:[http://www.clusterlabs.org/doc/en-US/Pacemaker/1.1/html/Pacemaker_Explained/ap-upgrade.html] must be used.
===========

ifdef::crm[]
=== Propagate the Configuration ===

Now we need to copy the changes so far to the other node:

[source,Bash]
----
# for f in /etc/corosync/corosync.conf /etc/hosts; do scp $f pcmk-2:$f ; done
corosync.conf                            100% 1528     1.5KB/s   00:00
hosts                                    100%  281     0.3KB/s   00:00
#
----
endif::[]
