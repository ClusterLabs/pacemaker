== Install &DISTRO; &DISTRO_VERSION; ==

=== Boot the Install Image ===

Download the 4GB
http://isoredirect.centos.org/centos/7/isos/x86_64/CentOS-7-x86_64-DVD-1503-01.iso[&DISTRO;
&DISTRO_VERSION; DVD ISO]. Use the image to boot a virtual machine, or
burn it to a DVD or USB drive and boot a physical server from that.

After starting the installation, select your language and keyboard layout at
the welcome screen.

.&DISTRO; &DISTRO_VERSION; Installation Welcome Screen

=== Installation Options ===

At this point, you get a chance to tweak the default installation options.

.&DISTRO; &DISTRO_VERSION; Installation Summary Screen
image::images/Installer.png["&DISTRO; &DISTRO_VERSION; Installation Summary",align="center",scaledwidth="100%"]

Ignore the *SOFTWARE SELECTION* section (try saying that 10 times quickly). The
*Infrastructure Server* environment does have add-ons with much of the software
we need, but we will leave it as a *Minimal Install* here, so that we can see
exactly what software is required later.

=== Configure Network ===

In the *NETWORK & HOSTNAME* section:

- Edit *Host Name:* as desired. For this example, we will use
  *pcmk-1.localdomain*.
- Select your network device, press *Configure...*, and manually assign a fixed
  IP address. For this example, we'll use 192.168.122.101 under *IPv4 Settings*
  (with an appropriate netmask, gateway and DNS server).
- Flip the switch to turn your network device on.

[IMPORTANT]
===========
Do not accept the default network settings.
Cluster machines should never obtain an IP address via DHCP, because
DHCP's periodic address renewal will interfere with corosync.
===========

=== Configure Disk ===

By default, the installer's automatic partitioning will use LVM (which allows
us to dynamically change the amount of space allocated to a given partition).
However, it allocates all free space to the +/+ (aka. *root*) partition, which
cannot be reduced in size later (dynamic increases are fine).

In order to follow the DRBD and GFS2 portions of this guide, we need to reserve
space on each machine for a replicated volume.

Enter the *INSTALLATION DESTINATION* section, ensure the hard drive you want to
install to is selected, select *I will configure partitioning*, and press *Done*.

In the *MANUAL PARTITIONING* screen that comes next, click the option to create
mountpoints automatically. Select the +/+ mountpoint, and reduce the desired
capacity by 1GiB or so. Select *Modify...* by the volume group name, and change
the *Size policy:* to *As large as possible*, to make the reclaimed space
available inside the LVM volume group. We'll add the additional volume later.

=== Configure Time Synchronization ===

It is highly recommended to enable NTP on your cluster nodes. Doing so
ensures all nodes agree on the current time and makes reading log files
significantly easier.

&DISTRO; will enable NTP automatically. If you want to change any time-related
settings (such as time zone or NTP server), you can do this in the
*TIME & DATE* section.

=== Finish Install ===

Select *Begin Installation*. Once it completes, set a root password, and reboot
as instructed. For the purposes of this document, it is not necessary to create
any additional users. After the node reboots, you'll see a login prompt on
the console. Login using *root* and the password you created earlier.

[NOTE]
======

From here on, we're going to be working exclusively from the terminal.

======

== Configure the OS ==

=== Verify Networking ===

Ensure that the machine has the static IP address you configured earlier.

-----
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# ip addr

    inet6 fe80::5054:ff:fed7:d608/64 scope link
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
-----

[NOTE]
=====
If you ever need to change the node's IP address from the command line, follow
these instructions, replacing *${device}* with the name of your network device:

....
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-${device} # manually edit as desired
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# nmcli dev disconnect ${device}
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# nmcli con reload ${device}
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# nmcli con up ${device}
....

This makes *NetworkManager* aware that a change was made on the config file.

=====

Next, ensure that the routes are as expected:

-----
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# ip route
default via 192.168.122.1 dev eth0  proto static  metric 100
192.168.122.0/24 dev eth0  proto kernel  scope link  src 192.168.122.101  metric 100
-----

If there is no line beginning with *default via*, then you may need to add a line such as

[source,Bash]
GATEWAY="192.168.122.1"

to the device configuration using the same process as described above for
changing the IP address.

Now, check for connectivity to the outside world. Start small by
testing whether we can reach the gateway we configured.

-----
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# ping -c 1 192.168.122.1
PING 192.168.122.1 (192.168.122.1) 56(84) bytes of data.

-----

Now try something external; choose a location you know should be available.

-----
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# ping -c 1 www.google.com

-----

=== Login Remotely ===

The console isn't a very friendly place to work from, so we will now
switch to accessing the machine remotely via SSH where we can
use copy and paste, etc.

From another host, check whether we can see the new host at all:

-----
beekhof@f16 ~ # ping -c 1 192.168.122.101
PING 192.168.122.101 (192.168.122.101) 56(84) bytes of data.

rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 1.012/1.012/1.012/0.000 ms
-----

Next, login as root via SSH.

-----
beekhof@f16 ~ # ssh -l root 192.168.122.101

[root@pcmk-1 ~]#
-----

=== Apply Updates ===

Apply any package updates released since your installation image was created:
----
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# yum update
----

=== Use Short Node Names ===

During installation, we filled in the machine's fully qualified domain
name (FQDN), which can be rather long when it appears in cluster logs and
status output. See for yourself how the machine identifies itself:
(((Nodes, short name)))

----
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# uname -n
pcmk-1.localdomain
----
(((Nodes, Domain name (Query))))

We can use the `hostnamectl` tool to strip off the domain name:
----
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# hostnamectl set-hostname $(uname -n | sed s/\\..*//)
----
(((Nodes, Domain name (Remove from host name))))

Now, check that the machine is using the correct name:
----
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# uname -n
pcmk-1
----

== Repeat for Second Node ==

Repeat the Installation steps so far, so that you have two
nodes ready to have the cluster software installed.

For the purposes of this document, the additional node is called
pcmk-2 with address 192.168.122.102.

== Configure Communication Between Nodes ==

=== Configure Host Name Resolution ===

Confirm that you can communicate between the two new nodes:

----
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# ping -c 3 192.168.122.102
PING 192.168.122.102 (192.168.122.102) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 192.168.122.102: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.343 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.122.102: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.402 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.122.102: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.558 ms

--- 192.168.122.102 ping statistics ---
3 packets transmitted, 3 received, 0% packet loss, time 2000ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.343/0.434/0.558/0.092 ms
----

Now we need to make sure we can communicate with the machines by their
name. If you have a DNS server, add additional entries for the two
machines. Otherwise, you'll need to add the machines to +/etc/hosts+
on both nodes. Below are the entries for my cluster nodes:

----
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# grep pcmk /etc/hosts
192.168.122.101 pcmk-1.clusterlabs.org pcmk-1
192.168.122.102 pcmk-2.clusterlabs.org pcmk-2
----

We can now verify the setup by again using ping:

----
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# ping -c 3 pcmk-2
PING pcmk-2.clusterlabs.org (192.168.122.101) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from pcmk-1.clusterlabs.org (192.168.122.101): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.164 ms

64 bytes from pcmk-1.clusterlabs.org (192.168.122.101): icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.186 ms

--- pcmk-2.clusterlabs.org ping statistics ---
3 packets transmitted, 3 received, 0% packet loss, time 2001ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.164/0.275/0.475/0.141 ms
----

=== Configure SSH ===

SSH is a convenient and secure way to copy files and perform commands
remotely. For the purposes of this guide, we will create a key without a
password (using the -N option) so that we can perform remote actions
without being prompted.

(((SSH)))

[WARNING]
=========
Unprotected SSH keys (those without a password) are not recommended for servers exposed to the outside world.
We use them here only to simplify the demo.
=========

Create a new key and allow anyone with that key to log in:

----

Test that you can now run commands remotely, without being prompted:
----
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# ssh pcmk-2 -- uname -n
pcmk-2
----

== Install the Cluster Software ==

Fire up a shell on both nodes and run the following to install pacemaker, and while
we're at it, some command-line tools to make our lives easier:
----
# yum install -y pacemaker pcs psmisc policycoreutils-python
----

[IMPORTANT]
===========
This document will show commands that need to be executed on both nodes
with a simple `#` prompt. Be sure to run them on each node individually.
===========

[NOTE]
===========
This document uses `pcs` for cluster management. Other alternatives,
such as `crmsh`, are available, but their syntax
will differ from the examples used here.
===========

== Configure the Cluster Software ==

=== Allow cluster services through firewall ===

On each node, allow cluster-related services through the local firewall:
----
# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=high-availability
success
# firewall-cmd --reload
success
----

[NOTE]
======
If you are using iptables directly, or some other firewall solution besides
firewalld, simply open the following ports, which can be used by various
clustering components: TCP ports 2224, 3121, and 21064, and UDP port 5405.

If you run into any problems during testing, you might want to disable
the firewall and SELinux entirely until you have everything working.
This may create significant security issues and should not be performed on
machines that will be exposed to the outside world, but may be appropriate
during development and testing on a protected host.

To disable security measures:
----
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# setenforce 0
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# sed -i.bak "s/SELINUX=enforcing/SELINUX=permissive/g" /etc/selinux/config
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# systemctl mask firewalld.service
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# systemctl stop firewalld.service
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# iptables --flush
----
======

=== Enable pcs Daemon ===

Before the cluster can be configured, the pcs daemon must be started and enabled
to start at boot time on each node. This daemon works with the pcs command-line interface
to manage synchronizing the corosync configuration across all nodes in the cluster.

Start and enable the daemon by issuing the following commands on each node:

----
# systemctl start pcsd.service
# systemctl enable pcsd.service
ln -s '/usr/lib/systemd/system/pcsd.service' '/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/pcsd.service'
----

The installed packages will create a *hacluster* user with a disabled password.
While this is fine for running `pcs` commands locally,
the account needs a login password in order to perform such tasks as syncing
the corosync configuration, or starting and stopping the cluster on other nodes.

This tutorial will make use of such commands,
so now we will set a password for the *hacluster* user, using the same password
on both nodes:

----
# passwd hacluster
Changing password for user hacluster.
New password:
Retype new password:
passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully.
----

[NOTE]
===========
Alternatively, to script this process or set the password on a
different machine from the one you're logged into, you can use
the `--stdin` option for `passwd`:

----
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# ssh pcmk-2 -- 'echo redhat1 | passwd --stdin hacluster'
----
===========

=== Configure Corosync ===

On either node, use `pcs cluster auth` to authenticate as the *hacluster* user:

----
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# pcs cluster auth pcmk-1 pcmk-2
Username: hacluster
Password:
pcmk-1: Authorized
pcmk-2: Authorized
----

Next, use `pcs cluster setup` on the same node to generate and synchronize the
corosync configuration:
----
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# pcs cluster setup --name mycluster pcmk-1 pcmk-2
Shutting down pacemaker/corosync services...
Redirecting to /bin/systemctl stop  pacemaker.service
Redirecting to /bin/systemctl stop  corosync.service
Killing any remaining services...
Removing all cluster configuration files...
pcmk-1: Succeeded
pcmk-2: Succeeded
----

If you received an authorization error for either of those commands, make
sure you configured the *hacluster* user account on each node
with the same password.

[NOTE]
======
Early versions of pcs required that `--name` be omitted from the above command.

If you are not using `pcs` for cluster administration,
follow whatever procedures are appropriate for your tools
to create a corosync.conf and copy it to all nodes.

The `pcs` command will configure corosync to use UDP unicast transport; if you
choose to use multicast instead, choose a multicast address carefully.
footnote:[For some subtle issues, see the now-defunct http://web.archive.org/web/20101211210054/http://29west.com/docs/THPM/multicast-address-assignment.html or the more detailed treatment in
http://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/support/docs/ip/ip-multicast/ipmlt_wp.pdf[Cisco's
Guidelines for Enterprise IP Multicast Address Allocation] paper.]
======

The final corosync.conf configuration on each node should look
something like the sample in <<ap-corosync-conf>>.
