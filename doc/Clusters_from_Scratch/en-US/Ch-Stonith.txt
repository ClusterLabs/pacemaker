= Configure STONITH =

STONITH (Shoot The Other Node In The Head aka. fencing) protects your data from
being corrupted by rogue nodes or unintended concurrent access.

Just because a node is unresponsive doesn't mean it has stopped
accessing your data. The only way to be 100% sure that your data is
safe, is to use STONITH to ensure that the node is truly
offline before allowing the data to be accessed from another node.

STONITH also has a role to play in the event that a clustered service
cannot be stopped. In this case, the cluster uses STONITH to force the
whole node offline, thereby making it safe to start the service
elsewhere.

== Choose a STONITH Device ==

It is crucial that your STONITH device can allow the cluster to
differentiate between a node failure and a network failure.

The biggest mistake people make in choosing a STONITH device is to
use a remote power switch (such as many on-board IPMI controllers) that
shares power with the node it controls. In such cases, the cluster
cannot be sure if the node is really offline, or active and suffering
from a network fault.

Likewise, any device that relies on the machine being active (such as
SSH-based "devices" used during testing) are inappropriate.

== Configure the Cluster for STONITH ==

. Configure the STONITH device itself to be able to fence your nodes and accept
  fencing requests.

. Install the STONITH agent(s). To see what packages are available, run `yum
  search fence-agents fence-virt`. Be sure to install the package(s) on all
  cluster nodes.

. Find the correct STONITH agent script: `pcs stonith list`

. Find the parameters associated with the device: +pcs stonith describe pass:[<replaceable>agent_name</replaceable>]+

. Create a local copy of the CIB: `pcs cluster cib stonith_cfg`

. Create the fencing resource: +pcs -f stonith_cfg stonith create pass:[<replaceable>stonith_id
  stonith_device_type &#91;stonith_device_options&#93;</replaceable>]+

. Enable STONITH in the cluster: `pcs -f stonith_cfg property set stonith-enabled=true`

. If the device does not know how to fence nodes based on their uname,
  you may also need to set the special *pcmk_host_map* parameter.  See
  `man stonithd` for details.

. If the device does not support the *list* command, you may also need
  to set the special *pcmk_host_list* and/or *pcmk_host_check*
  parameters.  See `man stonithd` for details.

. If the device does not expect the victim to be specified with the
  *port* parameter, you may also need to set the special
  *pcmk_host_argument* parameter. See `man stonithd` for details.

. Commit the new configuration: `pcs cluster cib-push stonith_cfg`

. Once the STONITH resource is running, test it (you might want to stop
  the cluster on that machine first): +stonith_admin --reboot pass:[<replaceable>nodename</replaceable>]+

== Example ==

For this example, assume we have a chassis containing four nodes
and an IPMI device active on 10.0.0.1. Following the steps above
would go something like this:

Step 1: Configure the IP address, authentication credentials, etc. in the IPMI device itself.

Step 2: Install the *fence-agents-ipmilan* package on both nodes.

Step 3: Choose the *fence_ipmilan* STONITH agent.

Step 4: Obtain the agent's possible parameters:
----
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# pcs stonith describe fence_ipmilan
Stonith options for: fence_ipmilan
  ipport: TCP/UDP port to use for connection with device
  inet6_only: Forces agent to use IPv6 addresses only
  ipaddr (required): IP Address or Hostname
  passwd_script: Script to retrieve password
  method: Method to fence (onoff|cycle)
  inet4_only: Forces agent to use IPv4 addresses only
  passwd: Login password or passphrase
  lanplus: Use Lanplus to improve security of connection
  auth: IPMI Lan Auth type.
  cipher: Ciphersuite to use (same as ipmitool -C parameter)
  privlvl: Privilege level on IPMI device
  action (required): Fencing Action
  login: Login Name
  verbose: Verbose mode
  debug: Write debug information to given file
  version: Display version information and exit
  help: Display help and exit
  power_wait: Wait X seconds after issuing ON/OFF
  login_timeout: Wait X seconds for cmd prompt after login
  power_timeout: Test X seconds for status change after ON/OFF
  delay: Wait X seconds before fencing is started
  ipmitool_path: Path to ipmitool binary
  shell_timeout: Wait X seconds for cmd prompt after issuing command
  retry_on: Count of attempts to retry power on
  sudo: Use sudo (without password) when calling 3rd party sotfware.
  stonith-timeout: How long to wait for the STONITH action to complete per a stonith device.
  priority: The priority of the stonith resource. Devices are tried in order of highest priority to lowest.
  pcmk_host_map: A mapping of host names to ports numbers for devices that do not support host names.
  pcmk_host_list: A list of machines controlled by this device (Optional unless pcmk_host_check=static-list).
  pcmk_host_check: How to determine which machines are controlled by the device.

Step 5: `pcs cluster cib stonith_cfg`

Step 6: Here are example parameters for creating our STONITH resource:
----
# pcs -f stonith_cfg stonith create ipmi-fencing fence_ipmilan \
      pcmk_host_list="pcmk-1 pcmk-2" ipaddr=10.0.0.1 login=testuser \
      passwd=acd123 op monitor interval=60s
# pcs -f stonith_cfg stonith
 ipmi-fencing	(stonith:fence_ipmilan):	Stopped 
----

Steps 7-10: Enable STONITH in the cluster:
----
# pcs -f stonith_cfg property set stonith-enabled=true
# pcs -f stonith_cfg property
Cluster Properties:
 cluster-infrastructure: corosync
 cluster-name: mycluster
 dc-version: 1.1.12-a9c8177
 have-watchdog: false
 stonith-enabled: true
----

Step 11: `pcs cluster cib-push stonith_cfg`
