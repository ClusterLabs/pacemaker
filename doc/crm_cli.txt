CRM CLI (command line interface) tool
======================================
Dejan_Muhamedagic,_Yan_Gao dejan@suse.de,ygao@novell.com
v0.93, September 23, 2009:

The CRM (a.k.a Pacemaker) is a Cluster Resource Manager which
implements the cluster configuration provided by the user in CIB
(Cluster Information Base). The CIB is a set of instructions
coded in XML. Editing the CIB is a challenge, not only due to its
complexity and a wide variety of options, but also because XML is
more computer than user friendly.

.Note
**************************
I do understand that there are people capable of
dealing with XML without an intermediary.
**************************

There are currently three options to manage the CIB, listed here
in a decreasing order of user-friendliness:

- the GUI (`hb_gui`)
- a set of command line tools
- `cibadmin(8)`

The GUI is very popular and it has recently seen a lot of good
development. For some it is going to be (or remain) the first
choice in cluster management.

The command line tools, lead by `crm_resource(8)`, are capable of
performing almost any kind of CIB transformation. The usage is,
however, plagued by the notorious weakness common to all UNIX
tools: a multitude of options, necessary for operation and yet
very hard to remember. Usage is also inconsistent at times.

The `cibadmin` is the ultimate CIB management tool: it applies
chunks of XML written by the user or generated by another tool to
the CIB. Very difficult to use without extensive training. Or
should I say drill. May be unnerving as well, in particular due
to sometimes cryptic error messages.

== Design goals

The CLI provides a consistent and unified interface to
CIB/cluster management. It uses the command line tools where
possible and may resort to XML and `cibadmin` when there is no
other option. That is the easiest way to ensure compatibility
between different management tools.

It may be used either as an interactive shell or for single
commands directly on the shell's command line. It is also
possible to feed it a set of commands from standard input or a
file, thus turning it into a scripting tool. Templates with ready
made configurations may help people to learn about the cluster
configuration or facilitate testing procedures.

The CLI may also be used for the CIB description and generation.
A file containing a set of CLI instructions may be applied to the
CLI tool to generate a complete CIB.

The new shadow CIB feature may also be put to use. The user may
work on one of the shadow CIBs and then apply (or commit) it in a
single step to the cluster.
 
It should also allow deployment of raw XML which may come either
from files or network.

Several modes of operation are available to restrict the set of
features depending on the user's proficiency.

The CLI is line oriented: every command must start and finish
on the same line. It is possible to use a continuation character
(`\`) to write one command in two or more lines.

The CLI has to be run on one of the cluster nodes.

.Note
**************************
Even though all sensible configurations (and most of those that
are not) are going to be supported by the CLI, I suspect that it
may still happen that certain XML constructs may confuse the
tool. When that happens, please file a bug report.

The CLI will not try to update the objects it does not
understand. Of course, it is always possible to edit such objects
in the XML format.
**************************

== Introduction to the user interface

Arguably the most important aspect of such a program is the user
interface. We begin with an informal introduction so that the
reader may get acquainted with it and get a general feeling of
the tool. It is probably best just to give some examples:

1. Command line (one-shot) use:

        # crm resource stop www_app

2. Interactive use:

        # crm
        crm(live)# resource
        crm(live) resource# unmanage tetris_1
        crm(live) resource# up
        crm(live)# node standby node4

3. Cluster configuration:

    # crm<<EOF
    configure
      erase
      #
      # resources
      #
      primitive disk0 iscsi \
        params portal=192.168.2.108:3260 target=iqn.2008-07.com.suse:disk0
      primitive fs0 Filesystem \
        params device=/dev/disk/by-label/disk0 directory=/disk0 fstype=ext3
      primitive internal_ip IPaddr params ip=192.168.1.101
      primitive apache apache \
        params configfile=/disk0/etc/apache2/site0.conf
      primitive apcfence stonith:apcsmart \
        params ttydev=/dev/ttyS0 hostlist="node1 node2" \
        op start timeout=60s
      primitive pingd pingd \
        params name=pingd dampen=5s multiplier=100 host_list="r1 r2"
      #
      # monitor apache and the UPS
      #
      monitor apache 60s:30s
      monitor apcfence 120m:60s
      #
      # cluster layout
      #
      group internal_www \
        disk0 fs0 internal_ip apache
      clone fence apcfence \
        meta globally-unique=false clone-max=2 clone-node-max=1
      clone conn pingd \
        meta globally-unique=false clone-max=2 clone-node-max=1
      location node_pref internal_www \
        rule 50: #uname eq node1 \
        rule pingd: defined pingd
      #
      # cluster properties
      #
      property stonith-enabled=true
      commit
    EOF

If you've ever done a CRM style configuration, you should be able
to understand the above examples without much difficulties.  The
CLI should provide a means to manage the cluster efficiently or
put together a configuration in a concise manner.

The `(live)` string in the prompt signifies that the current CIB
in use is the cluster live configuration. It is also possible to
work with the so-called shadow CIBs, i.e. configurations which
are stored in files and aren't active, but may be applied at any
time to the cluster.

Since the CIB is hierarchical such is the interface too. There
are several levels and entering each of them enables the user to
use a certain set of commands.

=== Shadow CIB usage

Shadow CIB is a new feature. Shadow CIBs may be manipulated in
the same way like the _live_ CIB, but these changes have no
effect on the cluster resources. The administrator may choose to
apply any of them to the cluster, thus replacing the running
configuration with the one which is in the shadow. The `crm`
prompt always contains the name of the configuration which is
currently in use. Note that, for obvious reasons, only commands
at the `configure` level make sense while working with a shadow
CIB.

No changes take place before the `configure commit` command.
Sometimes though, the administrator may start working with the
running configuration, but change mind and instead of committing
the changes to the cluster save them to a shadow CIB. This
short `configure` session excerpt shows how:
...............
    crm(live)configure# cib new test-2
    INFO: test-2 shadow CIB created
    crm(test-2)configure# commit
...............

=== Templates

Templates are ready made configurations created by cluster
experts. They are designed in such a way, so that users may
generate valid cluster configurations with minimum effort.
If you are new to Pacemaker/CRM, templates may be the best way to
start.

We will show here how to create a simple yet functional Apache
configuration:
...............
    # crm configure
    crm(live)configure# template
    crm(live)configure template# list templates
    apache       filesystem   virtual-ip   
    crm(live)configure template# new web <TAB><TAB>
    apache       filesystem   virtual-ip   
    crm(live)configure template# new web apache
    INFO: pulling in template apache
    INFO: pulling in template virtual-ip
    crm(live)configure template# list
    web2-d       web2         vip2         web3         vip          web
...............

We enter the `template` level from `configure`. Use the `list`
command to show templates available on the system.
The `new` command creates a configuration from the `apache`
template. You can use tab completion to pick templates. Note that
the apache template depends on a virtual IP address which is
automatically pulled along. The `list` command shows the just
created `web` configuration, among other configurations (I hope
that you, unlike me, will use more sensible and descriptive names).

The `show` command, which displays the resulting configuration,
may be used to get an idea about the minimum required changes
which have to be done. All `ERROR` messages show the line numbers
in which the respective parameters are to be defined:
...............
    crm(live)configure template# show
    ERROR: 23: required parameter ip not set
    ERROR: 61: required parameter id not set
    ERROR: 65: required parameter configfile not set
    crm(live)configure template# edit
...............

The `edit` command invokes the preferred text editor with the
`web` configuration. At the top of the file, the user is advised
how to make changes. A good template should require from the user
to specify only parameters. For example, the `web` configuration
we created above has the following required and optional
parameters (all parameter lines start with `%%`):
...............
    $ grep -n ^%% ~/.crmconf/web
    23:%% ip 
    31:%% netmask 
    35:%% lvs_support 
    61:%% id 
    65:%% configfile 
    71:%% options 
    76:%% envfiles 
...............

These lines are the only ones that should be modified. Simply
append the parameter value at the end of the line. For instance,
after editing this template, the result could look like this (we
used tabs instead of spaces to make the values stand out):
...............
    $ grep -n ^%% ~/.crmconf/web
    23:%% ip                192.168.1.101
    31:%% netmask 
    35:%% lvs_support 
    61:%% id                websvc
    65:%% configfile        /etc/apache2/httpd.conf
    71:%% options 
    76:%% envfiles 
...............

As you can see, the parameter line format is very simple:
...............
    %% <name> <value>
...............

After editing the file, use `show` again to display the
configuration:
...............
    crm(live)configure template# show
    primitive virtual-ip ocf:heartbeat:IPaddr \
            params ip="192.168.1.101"
    primitive apache ocf:heartbeat:apache \
            params configfile="/etc/apache2/httpd.conf"
    monitor apache 120s:60s
    group websvc \
            apache virtual-ip
...............

The target resource of the apache template is a group which we
named `websvc` in this sample session.

This configuration looks exactly as you could type it at the
`configure` level. The point of templates is to save you some
typing. It is important, however, to understand the configuration
produced.

Finally, the configuration may be applied to the current
crm configuration (note how the configuration changed slightly,
though it is still equivalent, after being digested at the
`configure` level):
...............
    crm(live)configure template# apply 
    crm(live)configure template# cd ..
    crm(live)configure# show
    node xen-b
    node xen-c
    primitive apache ocf:heartbeat:apache \
        params configfile="/etc/apache2/httpd.conf" \
        op monitor interval="120s" timeout="60s"
    primitive virtual-ip ocf:heartbeat:IPaddr \
        params ip="192.168.1.101"
    group websvc apache virtual-ip
...............

Note that this still does not commit the configuration to the CIB
which is used in the shell, either the running one (`live`) or
some shadow CIB. For that you still need to execute the `commit`
command.

We should also define the preferred node to run the service:
...............
    crm(live)configure# location websvc-pref websvc 100: xen-b
...............

If you are not happy with some resource names which are provided
by default, you can rename them now:
...............
    crm(live)configure# rename virtual-ip intranet-ip
    crm(live)configure# show
    node xen-b
    node xen-c
    primitive apache ocf:heartbeat:apache \
            params configfile="/etc/apache2/httpd.conf" \
            op monitor interval="120s" timeout="60s"
    primitive intranet-ip ocf:heartbeat:IPaddr \
            params ip="192.168.1.101"
    group websvc apache intranet-ip
    location websvc-pref websvc 100: xen-b
...............

To summarize, working with templates typically consists of the
following steps:

- `new`: create a new configuration from templates
- `edit`: define parameters, at least the required ones
- `show`: see if the configuration is valid
- `apply`: apply the configuration to the `configure` level

=== Tab completion

The `crm` makes extensive use of the tab completion of
`readline`. The completion is both static (i.e. for `crm`
commands) and dynamic. The latter takes into account the current
status of the cluster or information from installed resource
agents. Sometimes, completion may also be used to get short help
on resource parameters. Here a few examples:
...............
    crm(live)# resource <TAB><TAB>
    bye         exit        manage      param       show        unmanage 
    cd          failcount   meta        quit        start       unmigrate 
    cleanup     help        migrate     refresh     status      unmove 
    end         list        move        reprobe     stop        up 
    crm(live)# configure 
    crm(live)configure# primitive fence-1 <TAB><TAB>
    heartbeat:  lsb:        ocf:        stonith:    
    crm(live)configure# primitive fence-1 stonith:ipmilan params <TAB><TAB>
    auth=      hostname=  ipaddr=    login=     password=  port=      priv=
    crm(live)configure# primitive fence-1 stonith:ipmilan params auth=<TAB><TAB>
    auth* (string)
        The authorization type of the IPMI session ("none", "straight", "md2", or "md5")
    crm(live)configure# primitive fence-1 stonith:ipmilan params auth=
...............

[[SEMCHK]]
=== Configuration semantic checks

Resource definitions may be checked against the meta-data
provided with the resource agents. These checks are currently
carried out:

- are required parameters set
- existence of defined parameters
- timeout values for operations

The parameter checks are obvious and need no further explanation.
Failures in these checks are treated as configuration errors.

The timeouts for operations should be at least as long as those
recommended in the meta-data. Too short timeout values are a
common mistake in cluster configurations and, even worse, they
often slip through if cluster testing was not thorough. Though
operation timeouts issues are treated as warnings, make sure that
the timeouts are usable in your environment. Note also that the
values given are just _advisory minimum_---your resources may
require longer timeouts.

User may tune the frequency of checks and the treatment of errors
by the <<cmdhelp_options_check-frequency,`check-frequency`>> and
<<cmdhelp_options_check-mode,`check-mode`>> preferences.

Note that if the `check-frequency` is set to `always` and the
`check-mode` to `strict`, errors are not tolerated and such
configuration cannot be saved.

== Reference

We define a small and simple language. Most commands consist of
just a list of simple tokens. The only complex constructs are
found at the `configure` level.

The syntax is described in a somewhat informal manner: `<>`
denotes a string, `[]` means that the construct is optional, the
ellipsis (`...`) signifies that the previous construct may be
repeated, `|` means pick one of many, and the rest are literals
(strings, `:`, `=`).

=== `status`

Show cluster status. The status is displayed by `crm_mon`. Supply
additional arguments for more information or different format.
See `crm_mon(8)` for more details.

        status-attr <node> set <attr> <value>
        status-attr <node> delete <attr>
        status-attr <node> show <attr>
...............
Example:
...............
        status-attr node_1 show pingd
...............

[[cmdhelp_options,user preferences]]
=== `options`

The user may set various options for the CLI program itself.

[[cmdhelp_options_skill-level,set skill level]]
==== `skill-level`

Based on the skill-level setting, the user is allowed to use only
a subset of commands. There are three levels: operator,
administrator, and expert. The operator level allows only
commands at the `resource` and `node` levels, but not editing
or deleting resources. The administrator may do that and may also
configure the cluster at the `configure` level and manage the
shadow CIBs. The expert may do all.

Usage:
...............
        skill-level <level>
        
        level :: operator | administrator | expert
...............

[[cmdhelp_options_user,set the cluster user]]
==== `user`

Sufficient privileges are necessary in order to manage a
cluster: programs such as `crm_verify` or `crm_resource` and,
ultimately, `cibadmin` have to be run either as `root` or as the
CRM owner user (typically `hacluster`). You don't have to worry
about that if you run `crm` as `root`. A more secure way is to
run the program with your usual privileges, set this option to
the appropriate user (such as `hacluster`), and setup the
`sudoers` file.

Usage:
...............
        user system-user
...............
Example:
...............
        user hacluster
...............

[[cmdhelp_options_editor,set prefered editor program]]
==== `editor`

The `edit` command invokes an editor. Use this to specify your
prefered editor program. If not set, it will default to either
the value of the `EDITOR` environment variable or to one of the
standard UNIX editors (`vi`,`emacs`,`nano`).

Usage:
...............
        editor program
...............
Example:
...............
        editor vim
...............

[[cmdhelp_options_pager,set prefered pager program]]
==== `pager`

The `view` command displays text through a pager. Use this to
specify your prefered pager program. If not set, it will default
to either the value of the `PAGER` environment variable or to one
of the standard UNIX system pagers (`less`,`more`,`pg`).

[[cmdhelp_options_output,set output type]]
==== `output`

`crm` can adorn configurations in two ways: in color (similar to
for instance the `ls --color` command) and by showing keywords in
upper case. Possible values are `plain`, `color`, and
'uppercase'. It is possible to combine the latter two in order to
get an upper case xmass tree. Just set this option to
`color,uppercase`.

[[cmdhelp_options_colorscheme,set colors for output]]
==== `colorscheme`

With `output` set to `color`, a comma separated list of colors
from this option are used to emphasize:

- keywords
- object ids
- attribute names
- attribute values
- scores
- resource references

`crm` can show colors only if there is curses support for python
installed (usually provided by the `python-curses` package). The
colors are whatever is available in your terminal. Use `normal`
if you want to keep the default foreground color.

This user preference defaults to
`yellow,normal,cyan,red,green,magenta` which is good for
terminals with dark background. You may want to change the color
scheme and save it in the preferences file for other color
setups.

Example:
...............
    colorscheme yellow,normal,blue,red,green,magenta
...............

[[cmdhelp_options_check-frequency,when to perform semantic check]]
==== `check-frequency`

Semantic check of the CIB or elements modified or created may be
done on every configuration change (`always`), when verifying
(`on-verify`) or `never`. It is by default set to `always`.
Experts may want to change the setting to `on-verify`.

The checks require that resource agents are present. If they are
not installed at the configuration time set this preference to
`never`.

See <<SEMCHK,Configuration semantic checks>> for more details.

[[cmdhelp_options_check-mode,how to treat semantic errors]]
==== `check-mode`

Semantic check of the CIB or elements modified or created may be
done in the `strict` mode or in the `relaxed` mode. In the former
certain problems are treated as configuration errors. In the
`relaxed` mode all are treated as warnings. The default is `strict`.

See <<SEMCHK,Configuration semantic checks>> for more details.

[[cmdhelp_options_show,show current user preference]]
==== `show`

Display all current settings.

[[cmdhelp_options_save,save the user preferences to the rc file]]
==== `save`

Save current settings to the rc file (`$HOME/.crm.rc`). On
further `crm` runs, the rc file is automatically read and parsed.

[[cmdhelp_configure,CIB configuration]]
=== `configure`

This level enables all CIB object definition commands.

The configuration may be logically divided into four parts:
nodes, resources, constraints, and (cluster) properties and
attributes.  Each of these commands support one or more basic CIB
objects.

Nodes and attributes describing nodes are managed using the
`node` command.

Commands for resources are:

- `primitive`
- `monitor`
- `group`
- `clone`
- `ms`/`master` (master-slave)

There are three types of constraints:

- `location`
- `colocation`
- `order`

Finally, there are the cluster properties, resource meta
attributes defaults, and operations defaults. All are just a set
of attributes. These attributes are managed by the following
commands:

- `property`
- `rsc_defaults`
- `op_defaults`

The changes applied to the current CIB only on ending the
configuration session or using the `commit` command.

[[cmdhelp_configure_node,define a cluster node]]
==== `node`

The node command describes a cluster node. Nodes in the CIB are
commonly created automatically by the CRM. Hence, you should not
need to deal with nodes unless you also want to define node
attributes. Note that it is also possible to manage node
attributes at the `node` level.

Usage:
...............
        node <uname>[:<type>]
          [attributes <param>=<value> [<param>=<value>...]]

        type :: normal | member | ping
...............
Example:
...............
        node node1
        node big_node attributes memory=64
...............

[[cmdhelp_configure_primitive,define a resource]]
==== `primitive`

The primitive command describes a resource. It may be referenced
only once in group, clone, or master-slave objects. If it's not
referenced, then it is placed as a single resource in the CIB.

Operations may be specified in three ways. "Anonymous" as a
simple list of "op" specifications. Use that if you don't want to
reference the set of operations elsewhere. That's by far the most
common way to define operations. If reusing operation sets is
desired, use the "operations" keyword along with the id to give
the operations set a name and the id-ref to reference another set
of operations.

Operation's attributes which are not recognized are saved as
instance attributes of that operation. A typical example is
`OCF_CHECK_LEVEL`.

Usage:
...............
        primitive <rsc> [<class>:[<provider>:]]<type>
          [params attr_list]
          [meta attr_list]
          [operations id_spec]
            [op op_type [<attribute>=<value>...] ...]

        attr_list :: [$id=<id>] <attr>=<val> [<attr>=<val>...] | $id-ref=<id>
        id_spec :: $id=<id> | $id-ref=<id>
        op_type :: start | stop | monitor
...............
Example:
...............
        primitive apcfence stonith:apcsmart \
          params ttydev=/dev/ttyS0 hostlist="node1 node2" \
          op start timeout=60s \
          op monitor interval=30m timeout=60s

        primitive www8 apache \
          params configfile=/etc/apache/www8.conf \
          operations $id-ref=apache_ops

        primitive db0 mysql \
          params config=/etc/mysql/db0.conf \
          op monitor interval=60s \
          op monitor interval=300s OCF_CHECK_LEVEL=10
...............

[[cmdhelp_configure_monitor,add monitor operation to a primitive]]
==== `monitor`

Monitor is by far the most common operation. It is possible to
add it without editing the whole resource. Also, long primitive
definitions may be a bit uncluttered. In order to make this
command as concise as possible, less common operation attributes
are not available. If you need them, then use the `op` part of
the `primitive` command.

Usage:
...............
        monitor <rsc>[:<role>] <interval>[:<timeout>]
...............
Example:
...............
        monitor apcfence 60m:60s
...............

Note that after executing the command, the monitor operation may
be shown as part of the primitive definition.

[[cmdhelp_configure_group,define a group]]
==== `group`

The `group` command creates a group of resources.

Usage:
...............
        group <name> <rsc> [<rsc>...]
          [meta attr_list]
          [params attr_list]

        attr_list :: [$id=<id>] <attr>=<val> [<attr>=<val>...] | $id-ref=<id>
...............
Example:
...............
        group internal_www disk0 fs0 internal_ip apache \
          meta target_role=stopped
...............

[[cmdhelp_configure_clone,define a clone]]
==== `clone`

The `clone` command creates a resource clone. It may contain a
single primitive resource or one group of resources.

Usage:
...............
        clone <name> <rsc>
          [meta attr_list]
          [params attr_list]

        attr_list :: [$id=<id>] <attr>=<val> [<attr>=<val>...] | $id-ref=<id>
...............
Example:
...............
        clone cl_fence apc_1 \
          meta clone-node-max=1 globally-unique=false
...............

[[cmdhelp_configure_ms,define a master-slave resource]]
==== `ms` (`master`)

The `ms` command creates a master/slave resource type. It may contain a
single primitive resource or one group of resources.

Usage:
...............
        ms <name> <rsc>
          [meta attr_list]
          [params attr_list]

        attr_list :: [$id=<id>] <attr>=<val> [<attr>=<val>...] | $id-ref=<id>
...............
Example:
...............
        ms disk1 drbd1 \
          meta notify=true globally-unique=false
...............

.Note on `id-ref` usage
****************************
Instance or meta attributes (`params` and `meta`) may contain
a reference to another set of attributes. In that case, no other
attributes are allowed. Since attribute sets' ids, though they do
exist, are not shown in the `crm`, it is also possible to
reference an object instead of an attribute set. `crm` will
automatically replace such a reference with the right id:

...............
    crm(live)configure# primitive a2 www-2 meta $id-ref=a1
    crm(live)configure# show a2
    primitive a2 ocf:heartbeat:apache \
        meta $id-ref="a1-meta_attributes"
        [...]
...............
It is advisable to give meaningful names to attribute sets which
are going to be referenced.
****************************

[[cmdhelp_configure_location,a location preference]]
==== `location`

`location` defines the preference of nodes for the given
resource. The location constraints consist of one or more rules
which specify a score to be awarded if the rule matches.

Usage:
...............
        location <id> <rsc> {node_pref|rules}

        node_pref :: <score>: <node>

        rules ::
          rule [id_spec] [$role=<role>] <score>: <expression>
          [rule [id_spec] [$role=<role>] <score>: <expression> ...]

        id_spec :: $id=<id> | $id-ref=<id>
        score :: <number> | <attribute> | [-]inf
        expression :: <simple_exp> [bool_op <simple_exp> ...]
        bool_op :: or | and
        simple_exp :: <attribute> [type:]<binary_op> <value>
                      | <unary_op> <attribute>
                      | date <date_expr>
        type :: string | version | number
        binary_op :: lt | gt | lte | gte | eq | ne
        unary_op :: defined | not_defined

        date_expr :: lt <end>
                     | gt <start>
                     | in_range start=<start> end=<end>
                     | in_range start=<start> <duration>
                     | date_spec <date_spec>
        duration|date_spec ::
                     hours=<value>
                     | monthdays=<value>
                     | weekdays=<value>
                     | yearsdays=<value>
                     | months=<value>
                     | weeks=<value>
                     | years=<value>
                     | weekyears=<value>
                     | moon=<value>
...............
Examples:
...............
        location conn_1 internal_www 100: node1

        location conn_1 internal_www \
          rule 50: #uname eq node1 \
          rule pingd: defined pingd

        location conn_2 dummy_float \
          rule -inf: not_defined pingd or pingd lte 0
...............

[[cmdhelp_configure_colocation,colocate resources]]
==== `colocation` (`collocation`)

This constraint expresses the placement relation between two
resources.

Usage:
...............
        colocation <id> <score>: <rsc>[:<role>] <rsc>[:<role>]
...............
Example:
...............
        colocation dummy_and_apache -inf: apache dummy
...............

[[cmdhelp_configure_order,order resources]]
==== `order`

This constraint expresses the order of actions on two resources.

Usage:
...............
        order <id> score-type: <first-rsc>[:<action>] <then-rsc>[:<action>]
          [symmetrical=<bool>]

        score-type :: advisory | mandatory | <score>
...............
Example:
...............
        order c_apache_1 mandatory: apache:start ip_1
...............

[[cmdhelp_configure_property,set a cluster property]]
==== `property`

Set the cluster (`crm_config`) options.

Usage:
...............
        property [$id=<set_id>] <option>=<value> [<option>=<value> ...]
...............
Example:
...............
        property stonith-enabled=true
...............

[[cmdhelp_configure_rsc_defaults,set resource defaults]]
==== `rsc_defaults`

Set defaults for the resource meta attributes.

Usage:
...............
        rsc_defaults [$id=<set_id>] <option>=<value> [<option>=<value> ...]
...............
Example:
...............
        rsc_defaults failure-timeout=3m
...............

[[cmdhelp_configure_op_defaults,set resource operations defaults]]
==== `op_defaults`

Set defaults for the operations meta attributes.

Usage:
...............
        op_defaults [$id=<set_id>] <option>=<value> [<option>=<value> ...]
...............
Example:
...............
        op_defaults record-pending=true
...............

[[cmdhelp_configure_show,display CIB objects]]
==== `show`

The `show` command displays objects. It may display all objects
or a set of objects. The user may also choose to see only objects
which were changed.
Optionally, the XML code may be displayed instead of the CLI
representation.

Usage:
...............
        show [xml] [<id> ...]
        show [xml] changed
...............

[[cmdhelp_configure_edit,edit CIB objects]]
==== `edit`

This command invokes the editor with the object description. As
with the `show` command, the user may choose to edit all objects
or a set of objects.

If the user insists, he or she may edit the XML edition of the
object. If you do that, don't modify any id attributes.

Usage:
...............
        edit [xml] [<id> ...]
        edit [xml] changed
...............

[[cmdhelp_configure_delete,delete CIB objects]]
==== `delete`

Delete one or more objects. If an object to be deleted belongs to
a container object, such as a group, and it is the only resource
in that container, then the container is deleted as well. Any
related constraints are removed as well.

Usage:
...............
        delete <id> [<id>...]
...............

[[cmdhelp_configure_rename,rename a CIB object]]
==== `rename`

Rename an object. It is recommended to use this command to rename
a resource, because it will take care of updating all related
constraints and a parent resource. Changing ids with the edit
command won't have the same effect.

If you want to rename a resource, it must be in the stopped state.

Usage:
...............
        rename <old_id> <new_id>
...............

[[cmdhelp_configure_refresh,refresh from CIB]]
==== `refresh`

Refresh the internal structures from the CIB. All changes made
during this session are lost.

Usage:
...............
        refresh
...............

[[cmdhelp_configure_erase,erase the CIB]]
==== `erase`

The `erase` clears all configuration. Apart from nodes. To remove
nodes, you have to specify an additional keyword `nodes`.

Note that removing nodes from the live cluster may have some
strange/interesting/unwelcome effects.

Usage:
...............
        erase [nodes]
...............

[[cmdhelp_configure_ptest,show cluster actions if changes were committed]]
==== `ptest`

Show PE (Policy Engine) motions using `ptest(8)`.

A CIB is constructed using the current user edited configuration
and the status from the running CIB. The resulting CIB is run
through `ptest` to show changes which would happen if the
configuration is committed.

The status section may be loaded from another source and modified
using the <<cmdhelp_status,`status`>> level commands. In that case, the
`ptest` command will issue a message informing the user that the
Policy Engine graph is not calculated based on the current status
section and therefore won't show what would happen to the
running but some imaginary cluster.

If you have graphviz installed and X11 session, `dotty(1)` is run
to display the changes graphically.

Add a string of `v` characters to increase verbosity. `ptest`
can also show allocation scores.

Usage:
...............
        ptest [nograph] [v...] [scores]
...............
Examples:
...............
        ptest scores
        ptest vvvvv
...............

[[cmdhelp_configure_status,CIB status management and editing]]
==== `status`

Enter edit and manage the CIB status section level. See the
<<cmdhelp_status,CIB status management section>>.

[[cmdhelp_configure_template,edit and import a configuration from a template]]
==== `template`

The specified template is loaded into the editor. It's up to the
user to make a good CRM configuration out of it. See also the
<<cmdhelp_template,template section>>.

Usage:
...............
        template [xml] url
...............
Example:
...............
        template two-apaches.txt
...............

[[cmdhelp_configure_commit,commit the changes to the CIB]]
==== `commit`

Commit the current configuration to the CIB in use. As noted
elsewhere, commands in a configure session don't have immediate
effect on the CIB. All changes are applied at one point in time,
either using `commit` or when the user leaves the configure
level. In case the CIB in use changed in the meantime, presumably
by somebody else, the CLI will refuse to apply the changes. If
you know that it's fine to still apply them add `force`.

Usage:
...............
        commit [force]
...............

[[cmdhelp_configure_verify,verify the CIB with crm_verify]]
==== `verify`

Verify the contents of the CIB which would be committed.

Usage:
...............
        verify
...............

[[cmdhelp_configure_upgrade,upgrade the CIB to version 1.0]]
==== `upgrade`

If you get the `CIB not supported` error, which typically means
that the current CIB version is coming from the older release,
you may try to upgrade it to the latest revision. The command
to perform the upgrade is:
...............
    # cibadmin --upgrade --force
...............

If we don't recognize the current CIB as the old one, but you're
sure that it is, you may force the command.

Usage:
...............
        upgrade [force]
...............

[[cmdhelp_configure_save,save the CIB to a file]]
==== `save`

Save the configuration of the current level to a file.
Optionally, as XML.

Usage:
...............
        save [xml] <file>
...............
Example:
...............
        save myfirstcib.txt
...............

[[cmdhelp_configure_load,import the CIB from a file]]
==== `load`

Load a part of configuration (or all of it) from a local file or
a network URL. The `replace` method replaces the current
configuration with the one from the source. The `update` tries to
import the contents into the current configuration.
The file may be a CLI file or an XML file.

Usage:
...............
        load [xml] <method> URL

        method :: replace | update
...............
Example:
...............
        load xml update myfirstcib.xml
        load xml replace http://storage.big.com/cibs/bigcib.xml
...............

[[cmdhelp_template,edit and import a configuration from a template]]
=== `template`

User may be assisted in the cluster configuration by templates
prepared in advance. Templates consist of a typical ready
configuration which may be edited to suit particular user needs.

This command enters a template level where additional commands
for configuration/template management are available.

[[cmdhelp_template_new,create a new configuration from templates]]
==== `new`

Create a new configuration from one or more templates. Note that
configurations and templates are kept in different places, so it
is possible to have a configuration name equal a template name.

Usage:
...............
        new <config> <template> [<template> ...]
...............
Example:
...............
        new vip virtual-ip
...............

[[cmdhelp_template_load,load a configuration]]
==== `load`

Load an existing configuration. Further `edit`, `show`, and
`apply` commands will refer to this configuration.

Usage:
...............
        load <config>
...............

[[cmdhelp_template_edit,edit a configuration]]
==== `edit`

Edit current or given configuration using your favourite editor.

Usage:
...............
        edit [<config>]
...............

[[cmdhelp_template_delete,delete a configuration]]
==== `delete`

Remove a configuration. The loaded (active) configuration may be
removed by force.

Usage:
...............
        delete <config> [force]
...............

[[cmdhelp_template_list,list configurations/templates]]
==== `list`

List existing configurations or templates.

Usage:
...............
        list [templates]
...............

[[cmdhelp_template_apply,process and apply the current configuration to the current CIB]]
==== `apply`

Copy the current or given configuration to the current CIB. By
default, the CIB is replaced, unless the method is set to
"update".

Usage:
...............
        apply [<method>] [<config>]

        method :: replace | update
...............

[[cmdhelp_template_show,show the processed configuration]]
==== `show`

Process the current or given configuration and display the result.

Usage:
...............
        show [<config>]
...............

[[cmdhelp_status,CIB status management and editing]]
=== `status`

The `status` section of the CIB keeps the current status of nodes
and resources. It is modified _only_ on events, i.e. when some
resource operation is run or node status changes. For obvious
reasons, the CRM has no user interface with which it is possible
to affect the status section. From the user's point of view, the
status section is essentially a read-only part of the CIB. The
current status is never even written to disk, though it is
available in the PE (Policy Engine) input files which represent
the history of cluster motions. The current status may be read
using the `cibadmin -Q` command.

It may sometimes be of interest to see how status changes would
affect the Policy Engine. The set of `status` level commands
allow the user to load status sections from various sources and
then mimic resource operations or node changes. The effect of
those changes may then be observed by running the
<<cmdhelp_configure_ptest,`ptest`>> command.

[[cmdhelp_status_load,load the CIB status section]]
==== `load`

Load a status section from a file, a shadow CIB, or the running
cluster. By default, the current (`live`) status section is
modified. Note that if the `live` status section is modified it
is not going to be updated if the cluster status changes, because
that would overwrite the user changes. To make `crm` drop changes
and resume use of the running cluster status, run `load live`.

All CIB shadow configurations contain the status section which is
a snapshot of the status section taken at the time the shadow was
created. Obviously, this status section doesn't have much to do
with the running cluster status, unless the shadow CIB has just
been created. Therefore, the `ptest` command by default uses the
running cluster status section.

Usage:
...............
        load {<file>|shadow:<cib>|live}
...............
Example:
...............
        load bug-12299.xml
        load shadow:test1
...............

[[cmdhelp_status_save,save the CIB status section]]
==== `save`

The current internal status section with whatever modifications
were performed can be saved to a file or shadow CIB.

If the file exists and contains a complete CIB, only the status
section is going to be replaced and the rest of the CIB will
remain intact. Otherwise, the current user edited configuration
is saved along with the status section.

If the argument is omitted, the status is saved to wherever the
status section originated. Unless, of course, the origin is the
running cluster.

Usage:
...............
        save [<file>|shadow:<cib>]
...............
Example:
...............
        save bug-12299.xml
...............

[[cmdhelp_status_origin,display origin of the CIB status section]]
==== `origin`

Show the origin of the status section currently in use. This
essentially shows the latest `load` argument.

Usage:
...............

[[cmdhelp_status_show,show CIB status section]]
==== `show`

Show the current status section in the XML format. Brace yourself
for some unreadable output. Add `changed` option to get a human
readable output of all changes.

Usage:
...............
        show [changed]
...............

[[cmdhelp_status_node,change node status]]
==== `node`

Change the node status. It is possible to throw a node out of
the cluster, make it a member, or set its state to unclean.

`online`:: Set the `node_state` `crmd` attribute to `online`
and the `expected` and `join` attributes to `member`. The effect
is that the node becomes a cluster member.

`offline`:: Set the `node_state` `crmd` attribute to `offline`
and the `expected` attribute to empty. This makes the node
cleanly removed from the cluster.

`unclean`:: Set the `node_state` `crmd` attribute to `offline`
and the `expected` attribute to `member`. In this case the node
has unexpectedly disappeared.

Usage:
...............
        node <node> {online|offline|unclean}
...............
Example:
...............
        node xen-b unclean
...............

[[cmdhelp_status_op,edit outcome of a resource operation]]
==== `op`

Edit the outcome of a resource operation. This way you can
tell CRM that it ran an operation and that the resource agent
returned certain exit code. It is also possible to change the
operation's status. In case the operation status is set to
something other than `done`, the exit code is effectively
ignored.

Usage:
...............
        op <operation> <resource> <exit_code> [<op_status>] [<node>]

        operation :: probe | monitor[:<n>] | start | stop |
           promote | demote | notify | migrate_to | migrate_from
        exit_code :: <rc> | success | generic | args | 
           unimplemented | perm | installed | configured | not_running | 
           master | failed_master
        op_status :: pending | done | cancelled | timeout | notsupported | error

        n :: the monitor interval in seconds; if omitted, the first
           recurring operation is referenced
        rc :: numeric exit code in range 0..9
...............
Example:
...............
        op start d1 xen-b generic
        op start d1 xen-b 1
        op monitor d1 xen-b not_running
        op stop d1 xen-b 0 timeout
...............
