# Pacemaker Documentation

Pacemaker has multiple forms of documentation:

* The primary end-user documentation is a series of "books":

    * *Clusters From Scratch*: Simplified walk-through of setting up a cluster
      for the first time
    * *Pacemaker Administration*: Tips for managing a cluster
    * *Pacemaker Development*: How to work on the Pacemaker code base
    * *Pacemaker Explained*: Configuration reference guide
    * *Pacemaker Remote*: Configuration and walk-throughs for extended clusters

  The source for these is kept in this directory's sphinx subdirectory.
  Generated versions are available online in epub, PDF, and HTML format at:

    https://clusterlabs.org/pacemaker/doc/

* Annotated source code in HTML format can be generated by running
  "make global" in this directory, which requires the gtags and htags tools.
  This is generated for releases and can be viewed online at:

    https://clusterlabs.org/pacemaker/global/

* Pacemaker manual pages are generated and installed automatically when
  building the software. HTML versions can be generated by running
  "make manhtml" in this directory, which requires the groff tool.
  This is generated for releases and can be viewed online at:

    https://clusterlabs.org/pacemaker/man/

* For developers, documentation for Pacemaker's public C API is generated
  by running "make doxygen" in this directory, which requires the doxygen tool.
  This is generated for releases and can be viewed online at:

    https://clusterlabs.org/pacemaker/doxygen/

* Also for developers, a report of Pacemaker ABI compatibility between any two
  commits can be generated by running in this directory:

    make LAST_RELEASE=$EARLIER_COMMIT TAG=$NEWER_COMMIT abi-www

  which requires the abi-compliance-checker tool. This is generated for each
  release compared to the previous release and can be viewed online at:

    https://clusterlabs.org/pacemaker/abi/

* In addition, there are a few old text files in this directory focusing on
  particular characteristics of Pacemaker clusters. These are mostly outdated
  but do still have some useful information. The plan is to incorporate an
  updated version of them into the books.
