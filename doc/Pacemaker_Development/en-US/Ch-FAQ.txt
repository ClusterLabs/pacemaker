Who is this document intended for?::
 Anyone who wishes to read and/or edit the Pacemaker source code.
 Casual contributors should feel free to read just this FAQ, and
 consult other chapters as needed.

Where is the source code for Pacemaker?::
 indexterm:[downloads]
 indexterm:[source code]
 indexterm:[git,GitHub]
 The https://github.com/ClusterLabs/pacemaker[source code for Pacemaker] is
 kept on https://github.com/[GitHub], as are all software projects under the
 https://github.com/ClusterLabs[ClusterLabs] umbrella. Pacemaker uses
 https://git-scm.com/[Git] for source code management. If you are a Git newbie,
 the http://schacon.github.io/git/gittutorial.html[gittutorial(7) man page]
 is an excellent starting point. If you're familiar with using Git from the
 command line, you can create a local copy of the Pacemaker source code with:
 `git clone https://github.com/ClusterLabs/pacemaker.git pacemaker`

What are the different Git branches and repositories used for?::
 indexterm:[branches]
 * The https://github.com/ClusterLabs/pacemaker/tree/master[master branch]
   is the primary branch used for development.
 * The https://github.com/ClusterLabs/pacemaker/tree/1.1[1.1 branch] contains
   the latest official release, and normally does not receive any changes.
   During the release cycle, it will contain release candidates for the
   next official release, and will receive only bug fixes.
 * The https://github.com/ClusterLabs/pacemaker-1.0[1.0 repository] is a
   frozen snapshot of the 1.0 release series, and is no longer developed.

How do I build from the source code?::
 See the
 https://github.com/ClusterLabs/pacemaker/blob/master/README.markdown[README]
 in the main checkout directory.

What coding style should I follow?::
 You'll be mostly fine if you simply follow the example of existing code.
 When unsure, see the relevant chapter of this document for language-specific
 recommendations. Pacemaker has grown and evolved organically over many years,
 so you will see much code that doesn't conform to the current guidelines. We
 discourage making changes solely to bring code into conformance, as any change
 requires developer time for review and opens the possibility of adding bugs.
 However, new code should follow the guidelines, and it is fine to bring lines
 of older code into conformance when modifying that code for other reasons.

How should I format my Git commit messages?::
 indexterm:[git,commit messages]
 See existing examples in the git log. The first line should look like
 +change-type: affected-code: explanation+ where +change-type+ can be
 +Fix+ or +Bug+ for most bug fixes, +Feature+ for new features, +Log+ for
 changes to log messages or handling, +Doc+ for changes to documentation or
 comments, or +Test+ for changes in CTS and regression tests. You will
 sometimes see +Low+, +Med+ (or +Mid+) and +High+ used instead for bug fixes,
 to indicate the severity. The important thing is that only commits with
 +Feature+, +Fix+, +Bug+, or +High+ will automatically be included in the
 change log for the next release. The +affected-code+ is the name of the
 component(s) being changed, for example, +crmd+ or +libcrmcommon+ (it's more
 free-form, so don't sweat getting it exact). The +explanation+ briefly
 describes the change. The git project recommends the entire summary line stay
 under 50 characters, but more is fine if needed for clarity. Except for the
 most simple and obvious of changes, the summary should be followed by a blank
 line and then a longer explanation of 'why' the change was made.

How can I test my changes?::
 Most importantly, Pacemaker has regression tests for most major components;
 these will automatically be run for any pull requests submitted through
 GitHub. Additionally, Pacemaker's Cluster Test Suite (CTS) can be used to set
 up a test cluster and run a wide variety of complex tests. This document will
 have more detail on testing in the future.
