msgstr ""

#. Tag: para

msgid "The preferred use of virtual machines in a pacemaker cluster is as a cluster resource, whether opaque or as a guest node. However, it is possible to run the full cluster stack on a virtual node instead."
msgstr ""

#. Tag: para
#, no-c-format
msgid "This is commonly used to set up test environments; a single physical host (that does not participate in the cluster) runs two or more virtual machines, all running the full cluster stack. This can be used to simulate a larger cluster for testing purposes."

msgid "In a production environment, fencing becomes more complicated, especially if the underlying hosts run any services besides the clustered VMs. If the VMs are not guaranteed a minimum amount of host resources, CPU and I/O contention can cause timing issues for cluster components."
msgstr ""

#. Tag: para
#, no-c-format
msgid "Another situation where this approach is sometimes used is when the cluster owner leases the VMs from a provider and does not have direct access to the underlying host. The main concerns in this case are proper fencing (usually via a custom resource agent that communicates with the provider’s APIs) and maintaining a static IP address between reboots, as well as resource contention issues."

msgstr ""

#. Tag: para

msgid "Virtual machines may be configured following the process for remote nodes rather than guest nodes (i.e., using an <emphasis role=\"strong\">ocf:pacemaker:remote</emphasis> resource rather than letting the cluster manage the VM directly)."
msgstr ""

#. Tag: para

msgid "This is mainly useful in testing, to use a single physical host to simulate a larger cluster involving remote nodes. Pacemaker’s Cluster Test Suite (CTS) uses this approach to test remote node functionality."

msgid "The underlying host must install the libvirt driver for the desired container technology — for example, the <literal>libvirt-daemon-lxc</literal> package to get the <ulink url=\"http://libvirt.org/drvlxc.html:\">libvirt-lxc</ulink> driver for LXC containers."

Run it with the <literal>--help</literal> option for details on how to use it. It is intended for testing purposes only, and hardcodes various parameters that would need to be set appropriately in real usage. Of course, you can create XML definitions manually, following the appropriate libvirt driver documentation."
