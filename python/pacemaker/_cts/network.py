    Return the next available IP address.

    This function only increments the last portion of the IP address.  Once it
    has hit the upper limit, ValueError will be raised.

    Arguments:
    ip_base -- The initial IP address to start from.  The first call to next_ip
               will return the next IP address from this base.  Each subsequent
               call will return the next address from the previous call, so you
               can just omit this argument for subsequent calls.
    reset   -- Force next_ip to start from ip_base again.  This requires also
               passing the ip_base argument.  (Mostly useful for unit testing,
               but may be useful elsewhere).
