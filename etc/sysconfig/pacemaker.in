# Pacemaker start-up configuration
#
# This file contains environment variables that affect Pacemaker behavior.
# They are not options stored in the Cluster Information Base (CIB) because
# they may be needed before the CIB is available.
#


## Logging

# PCMK_logfacility
#
# Enable logging via the system log or journal, using the specified log
# facility. Messages sent here are of value to all Pacemaker administrators.
# This can be disabled using "none", but that is not recommended. Allowed
# values:
#
#  none
#  daemon
#  user
#  local0
#  local1
#  local2
#  local3
#  local4
#  local5
#  local6
#  local7
#
# Default: PCMK_logfacility="daemon"

# PCMK_logpriority
#
# Unless system logging is disabled using PCMK_logfacility=none, messages of
# the specified log severity and higher will be sent to the system log. The
# default is appropriate for most installations. Allowed values:
#
#  emerg
#  alert
#  crit
#  error
#  warning
#  notice
#  info
#  debug
#
# Default: PCMK_logpriority="notice"
# Warning: Debug logs may show sensitive configuration values.

# PCMK_logfile
#
# Unless set to "none", more detailed log messages will be sent to the
# specified file (in addition to the system log, if enabled). These messages
# may have extended information, and will include messages of info severity.
# This log is of more use to developers and advanced system administrators, and
# when reporting problems.
#
# Default: PCMK_logfile="@CRM_LOG_DIR@/pacemaker.log"

# PCMK_logfile_mode
#
# Pacemaker will set the permissions on the detail log to this value (see
# chmod(1)).
#
# Default: PCMK_logfile_mode="0660"

# PCMK_debug (Advanced Use Only)
#
# Whether to send debug severity messages to the detail log.
# This may be set for all subsystems (yes or no) or for specific
# (comma-separated) subsystems. Allowed subsystems are:
#
#  pacemakerd
#  pacemaker-attrd
#  pacemaker-based
#  pacemaker-controld
#  pacemaker-execd
#  pacemaker-fenced
#  pacemaker-schedulerd
#
# Default: PCMK_debug="no"
# Example: PCMK_debug="pacemakerd,pacemaker-execd"
# Warning: Debug logs may show sensitive configuration values.

# PCMK_stderr (Advanced Use Only)
#
# Whether to send daemon log messages to stderr. This would be useful only
# during troubleshooting, when starting Pacemaker manually on the command line.
#
# Setting this option in this file is pointless, since this file is not read
# when starting Pacemaker manually. However, it can be set directly as an
# environment variable on the command line.
#
# This accepts the same values as PCMK_debug.
#
# Default: PCMK_stderr="no"

# PCMK_trace_functions (Advanced Use Only)
#
# Send debug and trace severity messages from these (comma-separated)
# source code functions to the detail log.
#
# Default: PCMK_trace_functions=""
# Example: PCMK_trace_functions="unpack_colocation_set,pcmk__cmp_instance"
# Warning: Trace logs may show sensitive configuration values.

# PCMK_trace_files (Advanced Use Only)
#
# Send debug and trace severity messages from all functions in these
# (comma-separated) source file names to the detail log.
#
# Default: PCMK_trace_files=""
# Example: PCMK_trace_files="remote.c,watchdog.c"
# Warning: Trace logs may show sensitive configuration values.

# PCMK_trace_formats (Advanced Use Only)
#
# Send trace severity messages that are generated by these (comma-separated)
# format strings in the source code to the detail log.
#
# Default: PCMK_trace_formats=""
# Example: PCMK_trace_formats="TLS handshake failed: %s (%d)"
# Warning: Trace logs may show sensitive configuration values.

# PCMK_trace_tags (Advanced Use Only)
#
# Send debug and trace severity messages related to these (comma-separated)
# resource IDs to the detail log.
#
# Default: PCMK_trace_tags=""
# Example: PCMK_trace_tags="client-ip,dbfs"
# Warning: Trace logs may show sensitive configuration values.

# PCMK_blackbox (Advanced Use Only)
#
# Enable blackbox logging globally (yes or no) or by subsystem. A blackbox
# contains a rolling buffer of all logs (of all severities). Blackboxes are
# stored under @CRM_BLACKBOX_DIR@ by default, and their contents can
# be viewed using the qb-blackbox(8) command.
#
# The blackbox recorder can be enabled at start using this variable, or at
# runtime by sending a Pacemaker subsystem daemon process a SIGUSR1 or SIGTRAP
# signal, and disabled by sending SIGUSR2 (see kill(1)). The blackbox will be
# written after a crash, assertion failure, or SIGTRAP signal.
#
# Default: PCMK_blackbox="no"
# Example: PCMK_blackbox="pacemaker-controld,pacemaker-fenced"
# Warning: Blackboxes may contain sensitive configuration values.

# PCMK_trace_blackbox (Advanced Use Only)
#
# Write a blackbox whenever the message at the specified function and line is
# logged. Multiple entries may be comma-separated.
#
# Default: PCMK_trace_blackbox=""
# Example: PCMK_trace_blackbox="remote.c:144,remote.c:149"
# Warning: Blackboxes may contain sensitive configuration values.


## Option overrides

# PCMK_node_start_state
#
# By default, the local host will join the cluster in an online or standby
# state when Pacemaker first starts depending on whether it was previously put
# into standby mode. If this variable is set to "standby" or "online", it will
# force the local host to join in the specified state.
#
# Default: PCMK_node_start_state="default"

# PCMK_node_action_limit
#
# If set, this overrides the node-action-limit cluster option for this node to
# specify the maximum number of jobs that can be scheduled on this node (or 0
# to use twice the number of CPU cores).
#
# Default: unset
# Example: PCMK_node_action_limit="1"


## Crash Handling

# PCMK_fail_fast
#
# By default, if a Pacemaker subsystem crashes, the main pacemakerd process
# will attempt to restart it. If this variable is set to "yes", pacemakerd
# will panic the local host instead.
#
# Default: PCMK_fail_fast="no"

# PCMK_panic_action
#
# Pacemaker panics the local node under certain conditions (for example, losing
# quorum when no-quorum-policy is "suicide", or being notified of the local
# node's own fencing when fence-reaction is "panic"). This variable determines
# the panic behavior. Allowed values:
#
# reboot   Immediately reboot the host (not a clean reboot)
# off      Immediately kill power to the host (not a clean shutdown)
# crash    Trigger a kernel crash if possible, otherwise like reboot
# sync-reboot, sync-off, sync-crash
# 	   "sync-" can be put in front of any of the above values to synchronize
#          filesystems before panicking (making log messages more likely to be
#          preserved, but with the risk that the host may be left active if the
#          synchronization hangs)
#
# Default: PCMK_panic_action="reboot"


## Pacemaker Remote and remote CIB administration

# PCMK_remote_address
#
# By default, if the Pacemaker Remote service is run on the local node, it will
# listen for connections on all IP addresses. This may be set to one address to
# listen on instead, as a resolvable hostname or as a numeric IPv4 or IPv6
# address. When resolving names or listening on all addresses, IPv6 will be
# preferred if available. When listening on an IPv6 address, IPv4 clients will
# be supported via IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses.
#
# Default: PCMK_remote_address=""
# Example: PCMK_remote_address="192.0.2.1"

# PCMK_remote_port
#
# Use this TCP port number for Pacemaker Remote node connections. This value
# must be the same on all nodes.
#
# Default: PCMK_remote_port="3121"

# PCMK_ca_file
#
# The location of a file containing trusted Certificate Authorities, used to
# verify client or server certificates. This file must be in PEM format and
# must be readable by Pacemaker daemons (that is, it must allow read permissions
# to either the @CRM_DAEMON_USER@ user or the @CRM_DAEMON_GROUP@ group).
# If set, along with PCMK_key_file and PCMK_cert_file, X509 authentication
# will be enabled for Pacemaker Remote and remote CIB connections.
#
# Default: PCMK_ca_file=""

# PCMK_cert_file
#
# The location of a file containing the signed certificate for the server
# side of the connection. This file must be in PEM format and must be
# readable by Pacemaker daemons (that is, it must allow read permissions
# to either the @CRM_DAEMON_USER@ user or the @CRM_DAEMON_GROUP@ group).
# If set, along with PCMK_ca_file and PCMK_key_file, X509 authentication
# will be enabled for Pacemaker Remote and remote CIB connections.
#
# Default: PCMK_cert_file=""

# PCMK_crl_file
#
# The location of a Certificate Revocation List file, in PEM format. This
# setting is optional for X509 authentication.
#
# Default: PCMK_crl_file=""

# PCMK_key_file
#
# The location of a file containing the private key for the matching PCMK_cert_file,
# in PEM format. This file must be readable by Pacemaker daemons (that is, it
# must allow read permissions to either the @CRM_DAEMON_USER@ user or the
# @CRM_DAEMON_GROUP@ group). If set, along with PCMK_ca_file and PCMK_cert_file,
# X509 authentication will be enabled for Pacemaker Remote and remote CIB
# connections.
#
# Default: PCMK_key_file=""

# PCMK_authkey_location
#
# As an alternative to using X509 authentication for Pacemaker Remote
# connections, use the contents of this file as the authorization key. This
# file must be readable by Pacemaker daemons (that is, it must allow read
# permissions to either the @CRM_DAEMON_USER@ user or the @CRM_DAEMON_GROUP@
# group), and its contents must be identical on all nodes.
#
# Default: PCMK_authkey_location="@PACEMAKER_CONFIG_DIR@/authkey"

# PCMK_cib_authkey_location
#
# As an alternative to using X509 authentication for remote CIB operations,
# use the contents of this file as the authorization key. This file must be
# readable by Pacemaker daemons (that is, it must allow read permissions
# to either the @CRM_DAEMON_USER@ user or the @CRM_DAEMON_GROUP@ group), and
# its contents must be identical on both the cluster nodes and the remote
# administration system.
#
# Default: PCMK_cib_authkey_location="@PACEMAKER_CONFIG_DIR@/cib_authkey"

# PCMK_remote_pid1 (Advanced Use Only)
#
# When a bundle resource's "run-command" option is left to default, Pacemaker
# Remote runs as PID 1 in the bundle's containers. When it does so, it loads
# environment variables from the container's
# @PACEMAKER_CONFIG_DIR@/pcmk-init.env and performs the PID 1 responsibility of
# reaping dead subprocesses.
#
# This option controls whether those actions are performed when Pacemaker
# Remote is not running as PID 1. It is intended primarily for developer testing
# but can be useful when "run-command" is set to a separate, custom PID 1
# process that launches Pacemaker Remote.
#
# * If set to "full", Pacemaker Remote loads environment variables from
#   @PACEMAKER_CONFIG_DIR@/pcmk-init.env and reaps dead subprocesses.
# * If set to "vars", Pacemaker Remote loads environment variables from
#   @PACEMAKER_CONFIG_DIR@/pcmk-init.env but does not reap dead subprocesses.
# * If set to "default", Pacemaker Remote performs neither action.
#
# If Pacemaker Remote is running as PID 1, this option is ignored, and the
# behavior is the same as for "full".
#
# Default: PCMK_remote_pid1="default"

# PCMK_tls_priorities (Advanced Use Only)
#
# These GnuTLS cipher priorities will be used for TLS connections (whether for
# Pacemaker Remote connections or remote CIB access, when enabled). See:
#
#   https://gnutls.org/manual/html_node/Priority-Strings.html
#
# Pacemaker will append ":+ANON-DH" for remote CIB access and ":+DHE-PSK:+PSK"
# for Pacemaker Remote connections, as they are required for the respective
# functionality.
#
# Default: PCMK_tls_priorities="@PCMK__GNUTLS_PRIORITIES@"
# Example: PCMK_tls_priorities="SECURE128:+SECURE192:-VERS-ALL:+VERS-TLS1.2"

# PCMK_dh_max_bits (Advanced Use Only)
#
# Set an upper bound on the bit length of the prime number generated for
# Diffie-Hellman parameters needed by TLS connections. The default is no
# maximum.
#
# The server (Pacemaker Remote daemon, or CIB manager configured to accept
# remote clients) will use this value to provide a ceiling for the value
# recommended by the GnuTLS library. The library will only accept a limited
# number of specific values, which vary by library version, so setting these is
# recommended only when required for compatibility with specific client
# versions.
#
# Clients do not use PCMK_dh_max_bits.
#
# Default: PCMK_dh_max_bits="0" (no maximum)


## Inter-process Communication

# PCMK_ipc_type (Advanced Use Only)
#
# Force use of a particular IPC method. Allowed values:
#
#  shared-mem
#  socket
#  posix
#  sysv
#
# Default: PCMK_ipc_type="shared-mem"


## Cluster type

# PCMK_cluster_type (Advanced Use Only)
#
# Specify the cluster layer to be used. If unset, Pacemaker will detect and use
# a supported cluster layer, if available. Currently, "corosync" is the only
# supported cluster layer. If multiple layers are supported in the future, this
# will allow overriding Pacemaker's automatic detection to select a specific
# one.
#
# Default: PCMK_cluster_type=""


## Developer Options

# PCMK_schema_directory (Advanced Use Only)
#
# Specify an alternate location for RNG schemas and XSL transforms.
#
# Default: PCMK_schema_directory="@PCMK_SCHEMA_DIR@"

# PCMK_remote_schema_directory (Advanced Use Only)
#
# Specify an alternate location on Pacemaker Remote nodes for storing newer
# RNG schemas and XSL transforms fetched from the cluster.
#
# Default: PCMK_remote_schema_directory="@PCMK__REMOTE_SCHEMA_DIR@"

# G_SLICE (Advanced Use Only)
#
# Affect the behavior of glib's memory allocator. Setting to "always-malloc"
# when running under valgrind will help valgrind track malloc/free better;
# setting to "debug-blocks" when not running under valgrind will perform
# (somewhat expensive) memory checks.
#
# Default: G_SLICE=""
# Example: G_SLICE="always-malloc"

# MALLOC_PERTURB_ (Advanced Use Only)
#
# Setting this to a decimal byte value will make malloc() initialize newly
# allocated memory and free() wipe it, to help catch uninitialized-memory and
# use-after-free bugs.
#
# Default: MALLOC_PERTURB_=""
# Example: MALLOC_PERTURB_="221"

# MALLOC_CHECK_ (Advanced Use Only)
#
# Setting this to 3 will make malloc() and friends print to stderr and abort
# for some (inexpensive) memory checks.
#
# Default: MALLOC_CHECK_=""
# Example: MALLOC_CHECK_="3"

# PCMK_valgrind_enabled (Advanced Use Only)
#
# Whether subsystem daemons should be run under valgrind. Allowed values are
# the same as for PCMK_debug.
#
# Default: PCMK_valgrind_enabled="no"

# PCMK_callgrind_enabled
#
# Whether subsystem daemons should be run under valgrind with the callgrind
# tool enabled. Allowed values are the same as for PCMK_debug.
#
# Default: PCMK_callgrind_enabled="no"

# VALGRIND_OPTS
#
# Pass these options to valgrind, when enabled (see valgrind(1)). "--vgdb=no"
# is specified because pacemaker-execd can lower privileges when executing
# commands, which would otherwise leave a bunch of unremovable files in /tmp.
#
# These options will also be passed to the callgrind tool if it's enabled.
# However, callgrind does not support all the same options as valgrind (in
# particular, it does not support "--leak-check=").  If you need that option
# or any other valgrind-specific options, add those here and make sure to set
# PCMK_callgrind_enabled="no".
#
# Default: VALGRIND_OPTS=""
VALGRIND_OPTS="--trace-children=no --vgdb=no --num-callers=25 --log-file=@PCMK__PERSISTENT_DATA_DIR@/valgrind-%p --suppressions=@datadir@/pacemaker/tests/valgrind-pcmk.suppressions --gen-suppressions=all"
