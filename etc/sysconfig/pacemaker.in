# Pacemaker start-up configuration
#
# This file contains environment variables that affect Pacemaker behavior.
# They are not options stored in the Cluster Information Base (CIB) because
# they may be needed before the CIB is available.
#


## Logging

# PCMK_logfacility
#
# Enable logging via the system log or journal, using the specified log
# facility. Messages sent here are of value to all Pacemaker administrators.
# This can be disabled using "none", but that is not recommended. Allowed
# values:
#
#  none
#  daemon
#  user
#  local0
#  local1
#  local2
#  local3
#  local4
#  local5
#  local6
#  local7
#
# Default: PCMK_logfacility="daemon"

# PCMK_logpriority
#
# Unless system logging is disabled using PCMK_logfacility=none, messages of
# the specified log severity and higher will be sent to the system log. The
# default is appropriate for most installations. Allowed values:
#
#  emerg
#  alert
#  crit
#  error
#  warning
#  notice
#  info
#  debug
#
# Default: PCMK_logpriority="notice"

# PCMK_logfile
#
# Unless set to "none", more detailed log messages will be sent to the
# specified file (in addition to the system log, if enabled). These messages
# may have extended information, and will include messages of info severity.
# This log is of more use to developers and advanced system administrators, and
# when reporting problems.
#
# Default: PCMK_logfile="@CRM_LOG_DIR@/pacemaker.log"

# PCMK_logfile_mode
#
# Pacemaker will set the permissions on the detail log to this value (see
# chmod(1)).
#
# Default: PCMK_logfile_mode="0660"

# PCMK_debug (Advanced Use Only)
#
# Whether to send debug severity messages to the detail log.
# This may be set for all subsystems (yes or no) or for specific
# (comma-separated) subsystems. Allowed subsystems are:
#
#  pacemakerd
#  pacemaker-attrd
#  pacemaker-based
#  pacemaker-controld
#  pacemaker-execd
#  pacemaker-fenced
#  pacemaker-schedulerd
#
# Default: PCMK_debug="no"
# Example: PCMK_debug="pacemakerd,pacemaker-execd"

# PCMK_trace_functions (Advanced Use Only)
#
# Send debug and trace severity messages from these (comma-separated)
# source code functions to the detail log.
#
# Default: PCMK_trace_functions=""
# Example: PCMK_trace_functions="unpack_colocation_set,pcmk__cmp_instance"

# PCMK_trace_files (Advanced Use Only)
#
# Send debug and trace severity messages from all functions in these
# (comma-separated) source file names to the detail log.
#
# Default: PCMK_trace_files=""
# Example: PCMK_trace_files="remote.c,watchdog.c"

# PCMK_trace_formats (Advanced Use Only)
#
# Send trace severity messages that are generated by these (comma-separated)
# format strings in the source code to the detail log.
#
# Default: PCMK_trace_formats=""
# Example: PCMK_trace_formats="TLS handshake failed: %s (%d)"

# PCMK_trace_tags (Advanced Use Only)
#
# Send debug and trace severity messages related to these (comma-separated)
# resource IDs to the detail log.
#
# Default: PCMK_trace_tags=""
# Example: PCMK_trace_tags="client-ip,dbfs"

# PCMK_blackbox (Advanced Use Only)
#
# Enable blackbox logging globally (yes or no) or by subsystem. A blackbox
# contains a rolling buffer of all logs (of all severities). Blackboxes are
# stored under @CRM_BLACKBOX_DIR@ by default, and their contents can
# be viewed using the qb-blackbox(8) command.
#
# The blackbox recorder can be enabled at start using this variable, or at
# runtime by sending a Pacemaker subsystem daemon process a SIGUSR1 or SIGTRAP
# signal, and disabled by sending SIGUSR2 (see kill(1)). The blackbox will be
# written after a crash, assertion failure, or SIGTRAP signal.
#
# Default: PCMK_blackbox="no"
# Example: PCMK_blackbox="pacemaker-controld,pacemaker-fenced"

# PCMK_trace_blackbox (Advanced Use Only)
#
# Write a blackbox whenever the message at the specified function and line is
# logged. Multiple entries may be comma-separated.
#
# Default: PCMK_trace_blackbox=""
# Example: PCMK_trace_blackbox="remote.c:144,remote.c:149"


## Node start state

# PCMK_node_start_state
#
# By default, the local host will join the cluster in an online or standby
# state when Pacemaker first starts depending on whether it was previously put
# into standby mode. If this variable is set to "standby" or "online", it will
# force the local host to join in the specified state. This has no effect on
# Pacemaker Remote nodes.
#
# Default: PCMK_node_start_state="default"


## Crash Handling

# PCMK_fail_fast
#
# By default, if a Pacemaker subsystem crashes, the main pacemakerd process
# will attempt to restart it. If this variable is set to "yes", pacemakerd
# will panic the local host instead.
#
# Default: PCMK_fail_fast="no"

# PCMK_panic_action
#
# Pacemaker will panic the local host under certain conditions. By default,
# this means rebooting the host. This variable can change that behavior: if
# "crash", trigger a kernel crash (useful if you want a kernel dump to
# investigate); if "sync-reboot" or "sync-crash", synchronize filesystems
# before rebooting the host or triggering a kernel crash. The sync values are
# more likely to preserve log messages, but with the risk that the host may be
# left active if the synchronization hangs.
#
# Default: PCMK_panic_action="reboot"


## Pacemaker Remote

# PCMK_authkey_location
#
# Use the contents of this file as the authorization key to use with Pacemaker
# Remote connections. This file must be readable by Pacemaker daemons (that is,
# it must allow read permissions to either the hacluster user or the haclient
# group), and its contents must be identical on all nodes.
#
# Default: PCMK_authkey_location="@PACEMAKER_CONFIG_DIR@/authkey"

# PCMK_remote_address
#
# By default, if the Pacemaker Remote service is run on the local node, it will
# listen for connections on all IP addresses. This may be set to one address to
# listen on instead, as a resolvable hostname or as a numeric IPv4 or IPv6
# address. When resolving names or listening on all addresses, IPv6 will be
# preferred if available. When listening on an IPv6 address, IPv4 clients will
# be supported via IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses.
#
# Default: PCMK_remote_address=""
# Example: PCMK_remote_address="192.0.2.1"

# PCMK_remote_port
#
# Use this TCP port number for Pacemaker Remote node connections. This value
# must be the same on all nodes.
#
# Default: PCMK_remote_port="3121"

# PCMK_tls_priorities (Advanced Use Only)
#
# These GnuTLS cipher priorities will be used for TLS connections (whether for
# Pacemaker Remote connections or remote CIB access, when enabled). See:
#
#   https://gnutls.org/manual/html_node/Priority-Strings.html
#
# Pacemaker will append ":+ANON-DH" for remote CIB access and ":+DHE-PSK:+PSK"
# for Pacemaker Remote connections, as they are required for the respective
# functionality.
#
# Default: PCMK_tls_priorities="@PCMK_GNUTLS_PRIORITIES@"
# Example: PCMK_tls_priorities="SECURE128:+SECURE192:-VERS-ALL:+VERS-TLS1.2"

# PCMK_dh_min_bits (Advanced Use Only)
#
# Set a lower bound on the bit length of the prime number generated for
# Diffie-Hellman parameters needed by TLS connections. The default is no
# minimum.
#
# The server (Pacemaker Remote daemon, or CIB manager configured to accept
# remote clients) will use this value to provide a floor for the value
# recommended by the GnuTLS library. The library will only accept a limited
# number of specific values, which vary by library version, so setting these is
# recommended only when required for compatibility with specific client
# versions.
#
# Clients (connecting cluster nodes or remote CIB commands) will require that
# the server use a prime of at least this size. This is recommended only when
# the value must be lowered in order for the client's GnuTLS library to accept
# a connection to an older server.
# 
# Default: PCMK_dh_min_bits="1024"

# PCMK_dh_max_bits (Advanced Use Only)
#
# Set an upper bound on the bit length of the prime number generated for
# Diffie-Hellman parameters needed by TLS connections. The default is no
# maximum.
#
# The server (Pacemaker Remote daemon, or CIB manager configured to accept
# remote clients) will use this value to provide a ceiling for the value
# recommended by the GnuTLS library. The library will only accept a limited
# number of specific values, which vary by library version, so setting these is
# recommended only when required for compatibility with specific client
# versions.
#
# Clients do not use PCMK_dh_max_bits.
#
# Default: PCMK_dh_max_bits="2048"


## Inter-process Communication

# PCMK_ipc_type (Advanced Use Only)
#
# Force use of a particular IPC method. Allowed values:
#
#  shared-mem
#  socket
#  posix
#  sysv
#
# Default: PCMK_ipc_type="shared-mem"

# PCMK_ipc_buffer (Advanced Use Only)
#
# Specify an IPC buffer size in bytes. This can be useful when connecting to
# large clusters that result in messages exceeding the default size (which will
# also result in log messages referencing this variable).
#
# Default: PCMK_ipc_buffer="131072"


## Developer Options

# PCMK_schema_directory (Advanced Use Only)
#
# Specify an alternate location for RNG schemas and XSL transforms.
#
# Default: PCMK_schema_directory="@CRM_SCHEMA_DIRECTORY@"

# G_SLICE (Advanced Use Only)
#
# Affect the behavior of glib's memory allocator. Setting to "always-malloc"
# when running under valgrind will help valgrind track malloc/free better;
# setting to "debug-blocks" when not running under valgrind will perform
# (somewhat expensive) memory checks.
#
# Default: G_SLICE=""
# Example: G_SLICE="always-malloc"

# MALLOC_PERTURB_ (Advanced Use Only)
#
# Setting this to a decimal byte value will make malloc() initialize newly
# allocated memory and free() wipe it, to help catch uninitialized-memory and
# use-after-free bugs.
#
# Default: MALLOC_PERTURB_=""
# Example: MALLOC_PERTURB_="221"

# MALLOC_CHECK_ (Advanced Use Only)
#
# Setting this to 3 will make malloc() and friends print to stderr and abort
# for some (inexpensive) memory checks.
#
# Default: MALLOC_CHECK_=""
# Example: MALLOC_CHECK_="3"

# PCMK_valgrind_enabled (Advanced Use Only)
#
# Whether subsystem daemons should be run under valgrind. Allowed values are
# the same as for PCMK_debug.
#
# Default: PCMK_valgrind_enabled="no"

# PCMK_callgrind_enabled
#
# Whether subsystem daemons should be run under valgrind with the callgrind
# tool enabled. Allowed values are the same as for PCMK_debug.
#
# Default: PCMK_callgrind_enabled="no"

# VALGRIND_OPTS
#
# Pass these options to valgrind, when enabled (see valgrind(1)). "--vgdb=no"
# is specified because pacemaker-execd can lower privileges when executing
# commands, which would otherwise leave a bunch of unremovable files in /tmp.
#
# Default: VALGRIND_OPTS=""
VALGRIND_OPTS="--leak-check=full --trace-children=no --vgdb=no --num-callers=25"
VALGRIND_OPTS="$VALGRIND_OPTS --log-file=@CRM_PACEMAKER_DIR@/valgrind-%p"
VALGRIND_OPTS="$VALGRIND_OPTS --suppressions=@datadir@/pacemaker/tests/valgrind-pcmk.suppressions"
VALGRIND_OPTS="$VALGRIND_OPTS --gen-suppressions=all"
